<p>We tend to use the words <em>program</em> and <em>process</em> interchangeably
much of the time. For instance, we might say <em>&#8220;my program died&#8221;</em>
or <em>&#8220;my program is generating too much output&#8221;</em>. There is a
distinction, however. A <strong>program</strong> refers to the code and static
data that is stored in a file (a program can also refer to the raw,
uncompiled source code). A <strong>process</strong>, on the other hand, is an
executing (or ready to execute) program in the computer. A process
is the program <em>plus</em> its execution context. The <strong>execution context</strong>
includes the state of the processor (<strong>processor context</strong>), which
is the value of its program counter and all of its registers. It
also includes the process&#8217; <strong>memory map</strong>, which identifies the various
regions of memory that have been allocated to the process.</p>

<p>The program stored on the disk contains the compiled code (called the
<strong>text</strong>) as well as initialized <strong>data</strong> (for example, initialized
global integers, strings, and string constants).
When the program is loaded into memory and additional space needs
to be allocated to hold dynamically-allocated data and the stack.
The memory map of a process includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>text</strong>: the machine instructions (the compiled program)</li>
<li><strong>data</strong>: initialized static and global data</li>
<li><strong>bss</strong>: uninitialized static data (e.g., global uninitialized strings, numbers, structures). The size of this region is contained within the program</li>
<li><strong>heap</strong>: dynamically allocated memory (obtained through memory allocation requests, such as <em>malloc</em> or <em>new</em>)</li>
<li><strong>stack</strong>: the call stack, which holds not just return addresses but also local variables, temporary data, and saved registers</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="processstates">Process states</h1>

<figure>
<img src="images/04-proc_states_1.png" alt="Process states" id="process_states" title="Process states" style="height:128;width:250;" />
<figcaption>Process states</figcaption></figure>



<p>At any point in time, a process can be in one of several states:</p>

<ol>
<li>A process is <strong>running</strong> if it currently has the CPU and is executing code.</li>
<li>A process is <strong>ready</strong> if it could run if only it had the CPU.</li>
<li>A process is <strong>blocked</strong> when it cannot run because it is waiting for some event to occur (for example, for an I/O operation to complete).</li>
</ol>

<p>On a single processor machine, only one process may be running at
a time, but multiple processes may be ready to run and several may
be blocked. The operating system will maintain a list of ready
processes and the <strong>scheduler</strong> is responsible for prioritizing
this list based on which processes deserve to run next. The operating
system maintains a separate list for blocked processes (unordered
because we don&#8217;t know what event will occur next).</p>

<p>A newly created process is placed at the back of the ready list,
which is commonly called the <strong>run queue</strong> (we will look at how this list is managed later when we consider process
scheduling). Eventually it moves to the head of the list and gets
a chance to run. After a while, it may, for example, perform a <em>read</em> system call
to get some data.
The operating system has to request the data to be read from the disk and
hence this data is not immediately available to be returned to the process.
Since the data is not ready, the process
is placed in a <em>blocked</em> state and another process is allowed to run. When the
operating system completes the read operation, the process is no
longer blocked and is put back on the run queue</p>

<p>If a running process does not get blocked (for example, it is compute
intensive), a hardware timer will eventually interrupt the operating
system and cause the operating system to stop (preempt) the process,
put it on the run queue, and give someone else a chance to run.
This is known as <strong>preemptive multitasking</strong>. Systems that do not
do this, such as the old Microsoft Windows 3.1 operating systems,
rely on the process to be well-behaved and decide to give up the
CPU every once in a while. These systems are <strong>non-preemptive</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="processesintheoperatingsystem">Processes in the operating system</h1>

<p>The scheduler is responsible for deciding what process gets to run
and for saving and restoring the state of a process as it gets
stopped and when it gets to run again.</p>

<p>The <strong>context</strong> of a process is its state. As we saw, this is its
text (the program code), all global variables and data structures
(data and bss), all dynamic memory (heap) that was allocated to the
process, the contents of the user and kernel stacks, and all machine
registers.</p>

<p>When a process is running, the system is said to be in the context
of that process. When the kernel decides to execute another process,
it does a <strong>context switch</strong>, causing the system to execute in a different
processâ€™ context. When doing a context switch, the kernel has to
save enough information so that it can switch back to the earlier process
and continue executing exactly where it left off. When a process executes
a system call and has to change from user to kernel mode, the kernel
also has to save enough information so that it can later return to
user mode and continue executing the program.</p>

<h1 id="processlistprocesscontrolblocks">Process list &amp; Process Control Blocks</h1>

<p>To keep track of processes, the operating system maintains a process
table (or list). Each entry in the process table corresponds to a particular
process and contains fields with information that the kernel needs
to know about the process. This entry is called
a <strong>Process Control Block</strong> (<strong>PCB</strong>)
Some of these fields on a typical Linux/Unix system PCB are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Machine state (registers, program counter, stack pointer)</li>
<li>Parent process and a list of child processes</li>
<li>Process state (ready, running, blocked)</li>
<li>Event descriptor if the process is blocked</li>
<li>Memory map (where the process is in memory)</li>
<li>Open file descriptors</li>
<li>Owner (user identifier). This determines access privileges &amp; signaling privileges</li>
<li>Scheduling parameters</li>
<li>Signals that have not yet been handled</li>
<li>Timers for accounting (time &amp; resource utilization)</li>
<li>Process group (multiple processes can belong to a common group)</li>
</ul>

<p>A process is identified by a unique number called the <strong>process ID</strong>
(<strong>PID</strong>). Some operating systems (notably UNIX-derived systems) have
a notion of a process group. A process group is just a way to lump
related processes together so that related processes can be signaled.
Every process is a member of some process group. This group membership
is inherited from the parent. If a process wishes to become a member
of a new group, it can run the <em>setpgrp</em> system call, which returns
a new group ID (if it is not already a group leader) and sets the
processâ€™ group to that ID. When a process is a group leader, its
process ID is the same as its process group ID.</p>

<figcaption>Process states and transitions in more detail</figcaption></figure>


<dl>
<dt>Created</dt>
<dd>(a) Temporary state when a process is created. When the initial memory is allocated, stack is set up,
 and the PCB is fully initialized, the process is then ready to run and is moved to the <em>ready</em>
 state and placed on the run queue.</dd>

<dt>Running in user mode</dt>
<dd>Running in user mode is the normal execution of a program: the CPU is
 executing the instructions that constitute your program: the compiled
 code and the various libraries that make up the program.</dd>

<dd>
<p>(b) Performing a system call invokes a <em>mode switch</em>, causing the
 process&#8217; flow of control to switch to the kernel and causing the
 processor to run in kernel mode. At this point, the operating
 system kernel code is executing but the operating system is still
 aware that the process is currently active and the flow of control
 is on behalf of the process.</p></dd>

<dd>
<p>Note that a hardware interrupt, such as that from the system
 timer, will also cause the state transition to kernel mode. This,
 however is, is not something that is part of the flow of control
 of the process. It represents a context switch into an <strong>interrupt
 context</strong>: a temporary kernel context for servicing interrupts.</p></dd>

<dt>Running in kernel mode</dt>
<dd>(c) The kernel may decide that it is time to schedule another
 process to execute and preempts the current process.
 The process is placed in the <em>ready</em> state and its process
 ID is put on the run queue.</dd>

<dd>
<p>(d) A process death (an exit or an abnormal termination)
 causes it to become a <strong>zombie</strong>. The process lingers in this
 state until the parent process executes a <em>wait</em> system call to get
 the state of this dead process (e.g., exit value). If there is no
 active parent process, then the zombie is eventually cleaned up by
 the <em>init</em> process (the very first process) and disappears.</p></dd>

<dd>
<p>(e) If a process needs to wait on an event (e.g. read data, wait for a message,
 sleep), it will be placed in a <em>blocked</em> state since it is not ready to
 run at this point.</p></dd>

<dd>
<p>(f) Once the process is rescheduled to run again, the kernel
 code restores the user state of the process and returns the process
 to user-mode running. Note that if no context switch took place
 on a system call (b), then the kernel simply returns to user mode (f) and
 the process continues to run.</p></dd>

<dt>Blocked</dt>
<dd>(g) If whatever it was that caused a process to become
 blocked occurs, the process is moved to the <em>ready</em> state and
 put on the run queue. For example, the process may have requested a <em>read</em> of
 data from the disk and the data has now been transferred to memory.</dd>

<dt>Ready to run</dt>
<dd>(h) When it is time for another process to run, the next scheduled process
 is taken off the run queue. If it is time for a preempted process
 to run again, the kernel completes the return from the interrupt
 that caused it to preempt the process.</dd>

<h2 id="howdoifindtheprocessidandgroup">How do I find the processâ€™ ID and group?</h2>

<p>A process can find its process ID with the <em>getpid</em> system call.
It can find its <em>process group number</em> with the <em>getpgrp</em> system call,
and it can find its parent&#8217;s process ID with <em>getppid</em>. For example:</p>

<div class="codeblock-box">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

main() {
	printf("my pid is %d\n", getpid());
	printf("my parentâ€™s pid is %d\n", getppid());
	printf("Iâ€™m in group %d\n", getpgrp());
}

<h1 id="creatingaprocess">Creating a process</h1>

<p>The <em>fork</em> system call clones a process into two processes
running the same code. <em>Fork</em> returns a value of 0 to the child and
a value of the process ID number (pid) to the parent. A value of
&#8211;1 is returned on failure.</p>

<div class="codeblock-box">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

main(int argc, char **argv) {
	switch (fork()) {
	case 0:
		printf("I'm the child: pid=%d\n", getpid());
		break;
	default:
		printf("I'm the parent: pid=%d\n", getpid());
		break;
	case -1:
		perror("fork");
	}
}

</ol>

<h1 id="runningotherprograms">Running other programs</h1>

<p><em>fork</em> is fine, but all It gives us is a set of essentially
identical clones to the original process. How do we run new programs?</p>

<p>The <em>execve</em> system call replaces the current process with a new
program. The syntax to <em>execve</em> is:</p>

<pre><code>execve(char *filename, char **argv, char **envp)
</code></pre>

<p>This system call returns only if the named program could not run.
<em>argv</em> is the argument list that is passed to main. The last item on
the list is 0 and the first, <em>argv[0]</em>, is ignored and expected to
contain the command name. <em>filename</em> contains the name of the program
to load and run. <em>envp</em> contains character strings representing the
environment in the form <em>name=value</em>. <em>envp</em> is also stored in the
global variable <em>char **environ</em> (<em>getenv</em> is a library function to
search the environment for a particular name).</p>

<p>In addition to the system call <em>execve</em>, there are a number of library
routines that are front-ends to <em>execve</em>. These are described in the
<em>exec</em> manual page. A couple of
useful ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>execlp</em>, which allows you to specify all the arguments on
the command line (the first parameter is the command and the last
must be a null pointer) and uses the search path set by the <em>PATH</em>
environment variable to find the command. For example,</p>

<p><code>execlp(&#8220;ls&#8221;, &#8220;ls&#8221;, &#8220;-al&#8221;, &#8220;/usr/paul&#8221;, 0)</code></p></li>
<li><p><em>execvp</em>, which is almost like <em>execve</em> except that the <em>PATH</em>
environment variable is user as a search path for the command and
the default environment is used. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<p>char **av[] = { &#8220;ls&#8221;, &#8220;-al&#8221;, &#8220;/home/paul&#8221;, 0};
execvp(&#8220;ls&#8221;, av);</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="exitingaprocess">Exiting a process</h1>

<p>A process exits by default after it finished executing <em>main</em>. However,
the <em>exit</em> call may be used to force a program to exit and/or to
specify a return value on exit (a number in the range of 0..255).</p>

<div class="codeblock-box">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
	printf("I'm outta here!\n");
	exit(5);
}
</div>

<p><a href="files/exit.c">Download this file</a></p></p>

<p>After compiling and running this program, run the shell command:</p>

<pre><code>echo $?
</code></pre>

<p>to see the exit code from the program.</p>

<h1 id="algorithmforexit">Algorithm for exit</h1>

<ol>
<li>Ignore all signals.</li>
<li>If the process is associated with a controlling terminal:

<ol>
<li>Send a hang-up signal to all members of the process group.</li>
<li>Reset process group for all members to 0.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Close all open files.</li>
<li>Release current directory.</li>
<li>Release current changed root, if any.</li>
<li>Free memory associated with the process.</li>
<li>Write an accounting record (if accounting).</li>
<li>Make the process state zombie.</li>
<li>Assign the parent process ID of any children to be 1 (init).</li>
<li>Send a death of child signal to parent process.</li>
<li>Context switch.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="signals">Signals</h1>

<p>Signals inform processes of the occurrence of asynchronous events.
Processes can send signals to other processes owned by the same
user (<em>root</em>, also known as the <em>superuser</em>, can send signals to anyone). The
UNIX kernel may also send signals to a process to notify it of
certain events.</p>

<h1 id="sendingasignal">Sending a signal</h1>

<p>A process can send a signal to another process with the kill system call. The syntax for this call is:</p>

<pre><code>kill(int pid, int signal_number)
</code></pre>

<p>where <em>pid</em> is the process ID and <em>signal_number</em> is
the signal that you want to send. Symbolic names for the signals
are defined in the include file <em>signal.h</em> and may be obtained via
the manual page (<em>man signal</em>). If the process ID is 0, then
the signal is sent to all processes in the same process group. It
pid is 1, the signal is sent to all processes with the same user
ID.</p>

<p>Here is an example. Let&#8217;s write a program to fork itself into two
processes: the parent will just look forever, printing <em>&#8220;I&#8217;m the
parent&#8221;</em>. The child will wait three seconds, kill the parent, and
exit. The signal that one sends to kill a process is SIGKILL (signal 9),
which forces the process to terminate.
The program looks like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock-box">#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	if (fork())		<span class="comment">/* fork, assume it always works */</span>
		for (;;)	<span class="comment">/* parent prints a message forever */</span>
			printf("Iâ€™m the parent\n");
	else {	<span class="comment">/* weâ€™re the child */</span>
		sleep(3);	<span class="comment">/* do nothing for three seconds */</span>
		kill(getppid(), SIGKILL);	<span class="comment">/* kill the parent */</span>
	}
}
</div>

<p><a href="files/kill.c">Download this file</a></p></p>

<h1 id="detectingsignals">Detecting signals</h1>

<p>One of three things can happen when receiving a signal:</p>

<ul>
<li>The process may be able to ignore it (some signals, like KILL, cannot be ignored.</li>
<li>The process can take whatever the system decided was the default action for the signal, which is usually killing the program.</li>
<li>The process can ask that a user-defined function be run when the signal is detected.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can specify what a function does when it gets a signal with the
<em>signal</em> system call. This call accepts two parameters: the first is
the signal number and the second is a pointer to a function that
will be run when the signal is detected. In place of a pointer to
a function, you can specify SIG_IGN to ignore the signal or SIG_DFL
to take the default action. <em>signal</em> returns a pointer to the function
that was the action that would have been taken if that signal would
have been received before you called signal. On some versions of
UNIX (SunOS in particular, not Linux or OS X), you have to reset the
signal request after a signal has been
received (call <em>signal</em> again).</p>

<p>Letâ€™s use the program from the previous example and modify it so
that the parent will catch a signal that is sent by the child. This
time we&#8217;ll send a signal called SIGUSR1, a signal that does not
correspond to any event and is reserved for use by user programs.</p>

<div class="codeblock-box">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	if (fork())	{	<span class="comment">/* fork, assume it always works here */</span>
		<span class="comment">/* --------- parent --------- */</span>
		void catchme();			<span class="comment">/* signal handling function */</span>
		signal(SIGUSR1, catchme);	<span class="comment">/* call catchme if we get SIGUSR1 */</span>
		for (;;)	<span class="comment">/* parent prints a message forever */</span>
			printf("Iâ€™m the parent\n");
	}
	else {	<span class="comment">/* weâ€™re the child */</span>
		sleep(3);	<span class="comment">/* do nothing for 3 seconds */</span>
		kill(getppid(), SIGUSR1);	<span class="comment">/* send SIGUSR1 to the parent */</span>
	}
}

void
catchme() {	<span class="comment">/* signal handler */</span>
	printf("got the signal!\n");
	exit(0);
}

</div>

<p><a href="files/signal.c">Download this file</a></p></p>

<p>The code is not a lot different. The parent calls <em>signal</em> to request
that anytime the process gets the signal SIGUSR1, it should run the
function <em>catchme</em>. The function <em>catchme</em> prints a message and exits.
If it did not exit, then the program would continue executing where
it left off after <em>catchme</em> returns, printing &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m the parent</em>&#8221;
<em>ad infinitum</em>.</p>

<h1 id="howdoesthekernelcheckforsignals">How does the kernel check for signals?</h1>

<p>Signals may occur asynchronously and often occur when the process
is not running (i.e., it may be blocked or ready). When either the
kernel or another user process decides to send a signal to another
process, all the kernel does is note the fact and set a bit in the
process control block for that process that there is a signal. When
the process is brought from the ready state to the running state,
the kernel takes a look to see whether the process has to receive
a signal when it starts running. Here are the essentials of this
signal detector in the kernel (in pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>while (&quot;received signal&quot; field in PCB is not zero) {
    find a signal number set to the process
    if (signal == death of child)
        if ignoring death of child
            free PCBs of zombies for this parent
        else
            return the signal
    else if not ignoring the signal
        return the signal
    turn off the &quot;received signal&quot; bit in the process control block
}
return &quot;no signal&quot;
</code></pre>

<h1 id="waitingforaprocesstodie">Waiting for a process to die</h1>

<div class="right-sidetext">
<em>Nota bene:</em> 
 If a process explicitly ignores SIGCHLD (death of a child), then the dead child is cleared as soon as it terminates
rather than remaining in the zombie state.
</div>

<p>When a child process dies, it sends a signal to the parent notifying
it of its death. The signal is known as SIGCHLD and is defined in
the include file <em>signal.h</em>. We can catch this signal with the <em>signal</em>
system call that allows us to assign a function to catch this
software interrupt. Once we get this interrupt, we can run the wait
system call to suspend the process until we get the death notification.
If we fail to do a wait and just exit, then the pending notification
would get inherited by the init process. The dead child remains a
zombie process until the process waits for it or it gets inherited
by process 1, init (the mother of all processes), who waits for all
processes.</p>

<p>The wait system call returns the process ID of a dead process. It also can fill an integer with the exit status that can be retrieved with the macro <em>WEXITSTATUS</em>.</p>

<pre><code>int pid, my_pid, status;
switch (my_pid=fork()) {
case 0:         /* do child stuff */ break;
case -1:        /* do error stuff */ break;
default:        /* wait for child to exit */
    while (pid=wait(&amp;status))
        if (pid==my_pid)
            printf(&quot;got exit of %d\n&quot;, WEXITSTATUS(status));
            break;
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="algorithmforwait">Algorithm for wait</h1>

<p>Hereâ€™s what the kernel does for a process that&#8217;s sleeping doing a wait:</p>

<pre><code>loop forever {
    if waiting process has a zombie child
        pick any zombie child
        add its CPU usage to the parent
        free child process control block
        return child ID and the exit code of the child
    if process has no children
        return error
    sleep at an interruptible priority
}
</code></pre>
