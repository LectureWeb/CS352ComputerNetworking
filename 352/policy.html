<h1> Paul's rules of the game </h1>
</div>

<p class="first">
I was somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of excuses, late assignments,
and even "collaborative" work I encountered when I first began teaching.
To avoid any misunderstandings and confusion, I wrote 
down some rules and policies I'll follow this semester.
I hope that they make sense and you can abide by them.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt> <a name="attendance"> attendance </a></dt>
	<dd> Attendance is mandatory and expected for both lectures and recitations. 
	You are responsible for all the topics 
	covered in class.  While I attempt to put most material on the
	web for your convenience, you are responsible for all material
	presented in class as well as announcements, assignments, and
	quizzes.  In case you might miss a lecture, 
	<em>make a friend now!</em>
	While I will endeavor to keep my web site up to date, the
	lecture is your primary source of updates and information.
	Attendance may be taken and/or there will be quizzes
	given throughout the semester. Missing a class will have no
	detrimental effect on your grade; missing several may.
	Please see the Rutgers policy on
        <a href="http://sasundergrad.rutgers.edu/academics/courses/registration-and-course-policies/attendance-and-cancellation-of-class">Attendance and Cancellation of Classes</a>.
	</dd>

    <dt> <a name="exams"> exams </a></dt>
	<dd> There will be four exams in this course: three in-semester
	exams and a cumulative final.  All exams will be weighted
	equally and the lowest normalized grade will be dropped
	(see the <a href="grades.html">grades</a> page for a description
	of normalization). I will post
	grades before the final exam that factor in your grades from
	three exams. This will be your final grade if you choose not
	to take the final (the final is effectively a grade of 0 and is dropped).
	If you take the final exam, it will serve <em>only</em> to displace
	an existing exam grade that is lower than your score on the final.
 	I will not reward you for the act of taking the final exam.
	<em>I will not give make-up exams or make-up assignments except
	under extraordinary circumstances such as a documented cases
	of serious injury or illness.</em>
	If you miss an exam then
	your grade for that exam is a 0. You will then have to take the
	final exam and the 0 grade will be dropped as the lowest 
	of the four grades.
	</dd>

    <dt> <a name="assignments"> assignments </a></dt>
	<dd> Assignments in this course will include both written
	problem as well as
	programming projects. Both of them count in your final grade,
	although programming projects will count more. All assignments
	are due on their due date (that's the definition of a due date)
	<em> before </em> the time specified.
	Late programming assignments will <em>not</em> be accepted. Try
	to hand in your work early to avoid unforseen disasters.
	Assignments must be submitted via sakai, The only formats accepted will
	be plain text, pdf, or HTML text within the assignment
	submission section of sakai.
        I will <em>not</em> accept any assignments that are submitted
        Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, Adobe InDesign, or any format that
        requires me to open an application.
	</dd>
	
    <dt> <a name="collaboration"> collaboration </a></dt>
	<dd> Except for group projects, <em>all homework is intended
	to be done without consulting 
	others.</em>
	Since discussion of work with fellow students can be a valuable
	learning experience (besides, the material is so fascinating that
	you won't be able to help it), you certainly may discuss the
	topics related
	to the problems with others. This brings us to the next bullet item...
	</dd>

    <dt> <a name="cheating"> cheating </a></dt>
	<dd> Cheating will not be tolerated. 
	All homework assignments, programming projects,
	and exams are to be done
	individually.
	Third-party code cannot be used unless you explicitly cite
	the use of a library.
	If you have problems in understanding the material
	or doing an assignment, please schedule an appointment to see me or a TA. 
	<strong>If you chance cheating and get caught, you will be
	reported to the office of student conduct and to the dean</strong>.
        The violation will go on your record and your punishment will, at the least,
        be a reduced grade but may include failing the course or suspension from
        the university.
        It's not worth it.
	Be sure you read the
	<a href="http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity-policy/">
	Rutgers policy on academic integrity</a>.
	It is <em>your</em> responsibility to ensure that your passwords are
	well-guarded, all files and directories protected, and printouts do not fall into
	other hands.
	</dd>

    <dt> <a name="office"> office hours </a></dt>
	<dd> I'm here to help you learn. If you have any questions or problems
	with the course material, assignments, or other matters in which I
	may be able to help you, feel free to contact me. You can
	send me mail 
	(I'll usually respond within a day) or schedule an appointment
	during my office hours. Don't just show up since I may not be
	there.
	Since class is on Livingston campus this semester, we will try to find
        some place to meet there to avoid the trek to Busch campus.
	</dd>

    <dt> <a name="phones"> phones and noise makers</a></dt>
	<dd> Ringing, beeping, or buzzing phones, laptops, games, and watches
	are disruptive.  Please turn these devices off upon the start of class.
	Violators may be charged a $20 penalty for the first offense, a $40 penalty
	for the second offense and confiscation of the device.  Further offenses will
	be fined at $20&middot;<em>2</em><sup>(n-1)</sup>.
	</dd>

    <dt> <a name="retention"> document retention </a></dt>
        <dd>
        I will have exams results available by the lecture following the exam (i.e., one week) and
        will return the papers to you then. If you were not in class and unable to pick up your exam,
        you have to ask me to bring it in via email at least a day before the next lecture. 
	You cannot ask a friend to pick it up.
	I will
        generally not carry old exams to each lecture waiting for you to show up. Final exams will
        not be returned. I will not keep any old exams beyond two weeks past the end of the semester.
        I will keep all your grades on record indefinitely so I can have them available in case
        you need letters of reference, job recommendations, or placement interviews.
        </dd>

    <dt> <a name="retention"> grade adjustment </a></dt>
        <dd>
        We will go over the exam when I return exams (the lecture following the exam).
        If you feel there has been a grading mistake,
        you can discuss it with me that week or the following week unless we both agree to
        other arrangements. After that, the grade is final and will not be changed.
        </dd>
