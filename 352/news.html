<dt> May 11 </dt>
<dd>
Final exam grades and final course grades are posted on <a href="https://sakai.rutgers.edu/portal">sakai</a>.
Final exam grades ranged from 29 to 99. 
</dd>

<dt> May 9 </dt>
<dd>
<p>
Reminder: the <a href="exam/index.html">final exam</a> takes place on Monday, May 9 from 8:00-10:00pm in our regular classroom.
Note that it is scheduled for a later time than our lectures.
If you are definitely
<em>not</em> planning to take the exam, have a non-zero bump grade, and have not informed me,
please let me know so I can print fewer copies.
</p>
<p>
If you are planning to take the final, be sure to arrive on time and to bring
your Rutgers ID.
</p>
<p>
Expect the material to focus on material from the latter two thirds of the course. I do not plan
to ask you about application layer protocols or the sockets API. Be sure you understand the transport,
network, and datalink layers. I will not about VoIP.
</p>

</dd>

<dt> May 3 </dt>
<dd>
<dd>
<p>
Pre-final grades are posted on <a href="https://sakai.rutgers.edu/portal">sakai</a>.
This is the grade that you will receive if you <strong>do not</strong> take the final. Grades are
on a standard 4-point scale: 4.0=A, 3.5=B+, 3.0=B, 2.5=C+, 2.0=C, 1.0=D, 0=F.
</p>
<p>
Final exam information is posted on the <a href="exam/index.html">exam page</a>.
</p>
<p>
You have the option of taking the final exam.
The <strong>Bump Grade</strong> that is posted on sakai is the
grade that you need to get on the final to raise your course grade to the next
half grade level (e.g., B to B+). A bump grade of 0 means that there is no grade on the final that will
increase your final course grade and you should not take the final.
In computing grades, I drop the lowest exam grade. Right now, you have a grade
of zero for the final exam and that grade is dropped. A better performance on
the final exam may result in another exam being dropped instead of the final.
If all your grades were generally consistent, it is unlikely that good performance
on the final will affect your grade. I will not reward you for taking the final.
</p>
<p>
If you decide that you definitely plan to take the exam, please let me know.
If your bump grade is not zero and you decide that you definitely plan <em>not</em> to take the exam, please let me know as
well so I will not print extra copies.
</p>
</dd>


<dt> April 22 </dt>

<p>
Reminder: Exam 3 takes place on Monday. Be sure to arrive on time, well-rested, and prepared.
I made minor fixes to the lecture notes and exam study guide (mostly correcting
typos, fixing some awkward sentences, and fixing a few markdown formatting errors).
To prepare, be sure to check:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="exam/index.html">List of topics</a> </li>
<li> <a href="exam/study-guide-3.html">Study guide</a></li>
<li> <a href="notes/index.html">Lecture notes</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt> April 18 </dt>
<dd>
It's a bit late in the semester to be sending this reminder but...
Note that 352 starts at 6:40pm. Please make every effort to get to the class on time. 
</dd>

<dt> April 6 </dt>
<dd>
There will be no 352 recitation today. 
<br/>
<a href="hw/a-8.html">Assignment 8</a> (a written assignment) is posted and due on 
Wednesday, April 13.
</dd>

<dt> March 25 </dt>
<dd>
I've posted an <a href="hw/a-7-faq.html">FAQ</a> for <a href="hw/a-7.html">assignment 7</a>.
Please check it periodically for answers to questions you might have or might not
even be aware you have. It also addresses the use of third-party libraries and 
possible problems you might experience with the newest version of dig on Linux 
(not on the iLab machines).
</dd>

<dt> March 18 </dt>
<dd>
In case you missed the update to the syllabus several weeks ago,
the announcement in class, and the information on the <a href="exam/index.html">exam info page</a>,
the second exam will take place on Monday, March 28.
</dd>

<dt> March 10 </dt>
<dd>
<a href="hw/a-7.html">Assignment 7 is posted</a> and is
due on Sunday, April 3, 2016 via sakai prior to 11:59pm.
<br/>
This is a programming assignment. You may work in a group if you wish but pay 
attention to the deadline and be aware that there will be an exam and written
assignments during this period so budget your time accordingly.
</dd>

<dt> February 24 </dt>
<dd>
<a href="hw/a-6.html">Assignment 6</a> (a written assignment) is posted and due on 
Wednesday, March 9.
I also posted the exam review under the <a href="notes/index.html">recitation notes</a>.

<a href="hw/a-5.html">Assignment 5</a> (a written assignment) is posted and due on

<dt> February 24 </dt>
<dd>
There will be no 352 recitation today.
</dd>

<dt> February 22 </dt>
<dd>
Reminder: the first exam takes place today. 
We will have a lecture for the first third or half of class followed by the exam.
Please plan to come on time to avoid distrupting the class. Latecomers to the exam
will not be permitted to take it.
</dd>

<dt> February 18 </dt>
<dd>
I posted an <a href="hw/a-3-faq.html">FAQ</a> for assignment 3. I will be updating it
with answers to questions that I feel would be of use to the class. Please check it periodically to 
ensure that you're not misunderstanding any aspect of the assignment.
</dd>

<dt> February 17 </dt>
<dd>
I had a typo in the <a href="exam/index.html">exam info</a> page where I stated that you are responsible
for material from the first three weeks of class for the first exam. That was a mistake: you are responsible
for the material from the first four weeks of class. The list of topics and study guide reflected this correctly.
</dd>

<dt> February 14 </dt>
<dd>
The first exam is in 10 days.
The <a href="exam/index.html">exam info page</a> contains a preliminary list of things you should and shouldn't know for the exam.
It also has a link to the exam from the last (and only) time I taught this class. Expect the format to be similar.
The page also has a link to a <a href="exam/study-guide-1.html">study guide</a>. It's somewhat long (about 23 pages if printed)
but I tried to put all the pertinent material along with some examples and some items that are not covered in the text.
If, in your studies, you find anything that is incorrect or just unclear, please let me know. I may make minor changes to both the
study list and study guide but do not expect to make substantial changes. I also fixed some
typos and added some clarifications in the lecture slides for <a href="notes/index.html">app layer protocols</a>.

Clarification on the homework:
For question 3, you should consider the delay before a packet can be transmitted. 
You have a stream of data coming in at 64,000 bits per second.
Before the first bit of the packet can be transmitted, you need to
generate the 56-byte packet. After that, you add the time to transmit
the packet (56 bytes at 2 megabits per second) and, finally, the
propagation delay (10 ms).

The thing to watch out for is units. The first number will probably
give you an answer in ms (milliseconds) while the second value will
likely be in &micro;s (microseconds). If you just use a calculator, you
should be ok. Express your answer in ms (milliseconds).
