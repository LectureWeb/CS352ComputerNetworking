<h1>
PART I &ndash; 32 points </h1>

<li> 8 Points </br/>
Suppose that Dijkstra's algorithm computed the following results for network costs starting from node <em>a</em>:

<table>
<tr>
<th>D(b), p(b)</th>
<th>D(c), p(c)</th>
<th>D(d), p(d)</th>
<th>D(e), p(e)</th>
<th>D(f), p(f)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2, a</td>
<td>1, a</td>
<td>2, c</td>
<td>4, d</td>
<td>3, d</td>
</tr>
</table>

(a) What is the full path from node <em>a</em> to node <em>f</em>? Express it as an ordered list of nodes starting from <em>a</em>.

<br/>

(b) Routing tables store first hops to a destination. What is the routing table at <em>a</em>? If some destination <em>n</em> is directly connected to <em>a</em>, write "<em>n</em>" for the next hop.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Destination</th> <th> First hop </th>
</tr>
<tr><td> b </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> c </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> d </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> e </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> f </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
</table>

</li><li> 8 Points <br/>
<p>
Node <em>B</em> has nodes <em>A</em> and <em>C</em> as neighbors. <em>B</em>'s initial distance vector is [<em>A</em>=1, <em>C</em>=2], identifying the cost of getting to <em>A</em> as 1 and the cost to <em>C</em> as 2.  <em>B</em> receives a distance vector from <em>A</em> that contains: [<em>B</em>=1, <em>D</em>=3, <em>E</em>=7, <em>F</em>=9]. Shortly after that, <em>B</em> receives a distance vector from <em>C</em> that contains [<em>B</em>=2, <em>D</em>=8, <em>E</em>=5]
</p>

<p>
(a) After <em>B</em> receives these two vectors, what is its view of least-cost distances from <em>B</em> to the following nodes? Express the distance as a single number.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Destination</th> <th> Least-cost distance </th>
</tr>
<tr><td> <em> A </em> </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> <em> C </em> </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> <em> D </em> </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> <em> E </em> </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> <em> F </em> </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
(b) After <em>B</em> updates its distance vector and sends it to <em>C</em>, what is <em>C</em>'s distance vector? Express the distance as a single number.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Destination</th> <th> Least-cost distance </th>
</tr>
<tr><td> <em> A </em> </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> <em> B </em> </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> <em> D </em> </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> <em> E </em> </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr><td> <em> F </em> </td> <td> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
</table>

<li> 8 Points <br/>
<p>
(a) State the number of bits that the CRC code will occupy given a generator of <strong>101</strong>.

<h1>
PART II &ndash; 68 points &ndash; 4 points each </h1>

<li> In a link-state routing protocol:
</br>(a) A node informs only its neighbors about changes to the state of any of its links.
</br>(b) The state of a link is dynamically queried to determine whether data can be routed through it.
</br>(c) The state of a link will change based on the state of other links that share the same node.
</br>(d) All nodes get updates on node connectivity so each node can build a full graph of the network.

</li><li> Poison reverse is designed to:
</br>(a) Detect invalid links on a route.
</br>(b) Handle the case where link costs may be asymmetric (that is, c(a, b) &ne; c(b, a)).
</br>(c) A spoofing technique to force a route to go through a specific machine.
</br>(d) Avoid creating routing loops.

</li><li> A multi-homed stub Autonomous System:
</br>(a) Is a subnetwork containing multiple systems but not connected to the Internet.
</br>(b) Is a subnetwork that is a member of multiple ASes at the same time.
</br>(c) Is a subnetwork that is connected to only one AS at a time.
</br>(d) Will not route traffic from one connected AS to another connected AS.

</li><li> Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) is used to:
</br>(a) Route messages from the receiver back to the sender.
</br>(b) Build a spanning tree.
</br>(c) Duplicate multicast packets and send them to interested destinations.
</br>(d) Ensure that forwarding loops do not develop.

</li><li> The Internet Group Multicast Protocol (IGMP):
</br>(a) Allows hosts to inform their connected routers that they are interested in joining a multicast group.
</br>(b) Allows a multicast sender to inform its connected router that it is interested in sending to a multicast group.
</br>(c) Establishes routes between multicast senders and multicast receivers.
</br>(d) All of the above.

</li><li> Channel partitioning protocols such as TDM or FDM:
</br>(a) Have a high probability of collisions.
</br>(b) May fail if any node in the network goes down.
</br>(c) Pass a token to nodes to give them permission to access the network.
</br>(d) Will never allow a node to use the full channel capacity.

</li><li> Collisions can occur in this form of MAC protocol:
</br>(a) Frequency division multiplexing.
</br>(b) Random access.
</br>(c) Token passing.
</br>(d) Polling.

</li><li> In CSMA/CD, binary exponential backoff is used to:
</br>(a) Make an adapter wait exactly double the previous interval whenever a frame experiences a collision.
</br>(b) Increase the chance that an Ethernet adapter will wait longer times as a frame experiences more collisions.
</br>(c) Require that an adapter first listen to the channel to sense that it is clear before transmitting.
</br>(d) Ensure that collisions cannot occur because two adapters will never transmit during the same time slot.

</li><li> IPv6's Neighbor Discovery protocol differs from ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) because:
</br>(a) It uses TCP instead of UDP for greater reliability.
</br>(b) A query is not sent to every host on the LAN.
</br>(c) Hosts never have to send queries because every host periodically sends announcements.
</br>(d) It uses a three-way handshake instead of a query-response.

</li><li> An Ethernet switch knows which interface to use to forward an incoming frame based on:
</br>(a) Having seen a source address in an earlier frame that arrived from that destination interface.
</br>(b) The administrator having configured a switch table to identify which addresses are at which interfaces.
</br>(c) The use of ARP to find the corresponding MAC address for an IP address.
</br>(d) Each interface on a switch having a distinct MAC address and the sender using it as a destination address.

</li><li> CSMA/CA:
</br>(a) Waits a random time interval before transmitting after a channel is sensed to be busy.
</br>(b) Is a taking-turns protocol; a device cannot transmit until it gets a token from the access point.
</br>(c) Waits a random time interval if a transmitted frame resulted in a collision.
</br>(d) Allocates time slots for each wireless station, which has to wait for its time slot before transmitting.

</li><li> Unlike Ethernet, 802.11 uses sequence numbers in its frame to allow the receiver to
</br>(a) Detect and discard duplicate frames.
</br>(b) Ensure that all frames are delivered to upper protocol layers in the proper order.
</br>(c) Request retransmission of missing frames.
</br>(d) All of the above.

</li><li> Request to Send / Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) is a feature of the 802.11 MAC to:
</br>(a) Provide acknowledgements from the access point to indicate that a frame has been received successfully.
</br>(b) Enable power management by telling the access point that a station will or will not be transmitting anymore.
</br>(c) Allow all stations to know that one station will be transmitting even if they are out of range of that station.
</br>(d) Allow one station to negotiate to receive a frame from another station, bypassing the access point.

</li><li> Differentiated Services (DiffServ) is a technique for:
</br>(a) Providing quality of service on a network by reserving router resources ahead of time.
</br>(b) Grouping datagram streams from different servers together if they are routed to the same client.
</br>(c) Identifying and prioritizing classes of network traffic by tagging IP datagrams.
</br>(d) Transforming an IP network into one with the properties of a circuit switched network.

</li><li> A weighted fair queuing link scheduling discipline:
</br>(a) Services output queues in strict priority order to ensure that their quality of service needs are met.
</br>(b) Uses multiple output queues and gives each of them an equal percentage of link bandwidth.
</br>(c) Prioritizes output queues but ensures that each gets a defined minimum percentage of link bandwidth.
</br>(d) Uses a single output queue per link and transmits packets in the order that they arrive.

</li><li> A leaky bucket algorithm primarily addresses which quality of service (QoS) problem?
</br>(a) Bandwidth
</br>(b) Delay
</br>(c) Jitter
</br>(d) Packet loss

</li><li> The Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is used to:
</br>(a) Schedule packets in a router's output queue.
</br>(b) Reserve socket resources on both the client and server.
</br>(c) Specify the quality of service needs for a stream of datagrams.
</br>(d) Police traffic to drop any datagrams that exceed a bandwidth threshold.

</li><li> The RTP Control Protocol, RTCP:
</br>(a) Is a version of the RTP (Real-Time Protocol) that uses reliable datagram delivery.
</br>(b) Dynamically modifies an RTP datagram stream to enforce quality of service guarantees.
</br>(c) Provides a sender with feedback on the quality of service that a receiver is getting.
</br>(d) Allows an administrator to configure quality of service parameters on an RTP datagram stream.
