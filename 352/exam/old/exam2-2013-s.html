<br/>(c) BitTorrent
<br/>(d) Chord DHT

</li><li>
<span class="comment">[this is not applicable to the forthcoming exam #2]</span></br>
Which peer-to-peer file sharing system is self-scaling for file downloads? That is, which system scales the bandwidth available to download a file as more users download that file?
<br/>(a) Napster
<br/>(b) Gnutella
<br/>(c) BitTorrent
<br/>(d) Chord DHT

</li><li>
<span class="comment">[this is not applicable to the forthcoming exam #2]</span></br>
A Kazaa <em>ultrapeer</em>:
<br/>(a) Avoids the need to query normal peers.
<br/>(b) Forwards queries to all of its connected normal peers.
<br/>(c) Is like a normal peer but hosts more content.
<br/>(d) Is a central server that keeps track of all the peers in the system.

</li><li>
<span class="comment">[this is not applicable to the forthcoming exam #2]</span></br>
A .torrent file in BitTorrent includes:
<br/>(a) The location of the tracker for the desired file.
<br/>(b) The location of seed nodes containing the file.
<br/>(c) The file data that is later distributed among peers.
<br/>(d) Just initial parts of the file data.

</li><li>
<span class="comment">[this is not applicable to the forthcoming exam #2]</span></br>
If a node leaves a Chord DHT (Distributed Hash Table), its (<em>key, value</em>) data:
<br/>(a) Moves to its successor node.
<br/>(b) Moves to its predecessor node.
<br/>(c) Is split between the predecessor and successor nodes.
<br/>(d) Is split among all remaining nodes.

</li><li> Why might using UDP instead of TCP be appealing?
<br/>(a) UDP supports much larger segment sizes.
<br/>(b) UDP uses a checksum to ensure data integrity.
<br/>(c) UDP segments are sent immediately.
<br/>(d) UDP segments are sequenced to arrive in order.

</li><li> What is the eight-bit Internet checksum of the two bytes {0xff, 0xff} (in binary: 1111 1111, 1111 1111)?
<br/>(a) 0x00 (0000 0000)
<br/>(b) 0x01 (0000 0001)
<br/>(c) 0xfe (1111 1110)
<br/>(d) 0xff (1111 1111)

</li><li> Sequence numbers in a stop-and-wait protocol are useful for:
<br/>(a) Ensuring data is delivered in the correct order.
<br/>(b) Distinguishing a new message from a duplicate.
<br/>(c) Keeping track of the total number of messages sent.
<br/>(d) Matching the receive window size with the transmit window size.

</li><li> You have a 1 Gbps network. The packet size is 1,000 bits and there is a 10 ms (10<sup>-2</sup> s) round-trip time between two hosts. What is the approximate network utilization with a stop-and-wait protocol?
<br/>(a) 0.01%
<br/>(b) 1%
<br/>(c) 10%
<br/>(d) Almost 100%

</li><li> With Go-Back-N, a segment can be deleted from the send buffer only when:
<br/>(a) It has been successfully received by the receiver.
<br/>(b) It and all prior segments have been successfully received by the receiver.
<br/>(c) All segments in the window have been successfully received by the receiver.
<br/>(d) The countdown timer expires after sending all segments in the window to the receiver.

</li><li> In a Go-Back-N protocol, a sender sends segments 5, 6, and 7. It gets back acknowledgements for segments 5 and 7. The acknowledgement for segment 6 does not arrive. What happens?
<br/>(a) The sender moves the base of its window to segment 8.
<br/>(b) The sender retransmits segment 6 upon getting the acknowledgement for segment 7.
<br/>(c) The sender retransmits segment 6 upon getting a timeout.
<br/>(d) The sender advances the base of its window to segment 6 and waits.

</li><li> Path MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) discovery relies on:
<br/>(a) The ability to send a query to a router for its MTU size.
<br/>(b) The ability to turn off fragmentation.
<br/>(c) Committing to an unchanging end-to-end route.
<br/>(d) Negotiating with the receiver to pick the maximum MTU that both can support.

</li><li> TCP without the Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) option behaves like a Go-Back-N protocol except that:
<br/>(a) Only the earliest unacknowledged segment is sent upon timeout.
<br/>(b) All unacknowledged segments are sent upon timeout.
<br/>(c) All segments in the current window are sent upon timeout.
<br/>(d) Only the last unacknowledged segment is sent upon timeout.

</li><li> A TCP header does not have this field:
<br/>(a) Source address
<br/>(b) Destination port
<br/>(c) Sequence number
<br/>(d) Checksum

</li><li> Host <em>A</em> sends the following consecutive TCP segments to host <em>B</em>: (1) sequence #1000, 500 bytes; (2) 500 bytes;
(3) 500 bytes. Host <em>B</em> receives only segments #1 and #3. What ACK does it send upon receiving segment #3?
<br/>(a) 1000
<br/>(b) 1500
<br/>(c) 2000
<br/>(d) 2500

</li><li> Suppose host <em>B</em> now receives segment #2 (after it receives segment #3). What ACK does it send back to host <em>A</em>?
<br/>(a) 1000
<br/>(b) 1500
<br/>(c) 2000
<br/>(d) 2500

</li><li> TCP's Slow Start:
<br/>(a) Provides an additive (linear) increase in transmission rate.
<br/>(b) Delays data transmission until a TCP connection is established.
<br/>(c) Provides a multiplicative decrease in the transmission rate.
<br/>(d) Provides an exponential increase in transmission rate.

</li><li> The chart above shows TCP's congestion window over time. What happened at (A)?
<br/>(a) A retransmission timer expired.
<br/>(b) Three duplicate ACKs were received. 
<br/>(c) The maximum window size was reached.
<br/>(d) The <code>ssthresh</code> value was reached.

<br/>(b) Three duplicate ACKs were received.
<br/>(c) The maximum window size was reached.
<br/>(d) The <code>ssthresh</code> value was reached.

</li><li> TCP Fast Retransmit retransmits:
<br/>(a) One segment without waiting for a timeout.
<br/>(b) Every unacknowledged segment if it detects the loss of one segment.
<br/>(c) A segment immediately upon getting a negative ACK from the sender.
<br/>(d) Retransmits a segment upon getting a retransmission timeout.

</li><li> Which router architecture does not require replicating the forwarding table?
