<h1> CS 352 Exam info </h1>
</div>

<p>
The final exam will be held in our regular classroom on
<strong>May 9, 2016 from 8:00-10:00pm</strong>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Please be sure to arrive on time and bring your ID!</b>
Expect a format similar to the other exams: a few short-answer questions and a larger number of 
multiple-choice questions in the style of those on mid-semester exams.
</p>
<p>
Remember that the final is optional and will only serve to displace
a lower normalized grade on one of the three exams. It will not make up
for poor performance on quizzes or assignments.
</p>

<h1>
Exam rules
</h1>
<p>
Be sure to arrive on time. If you arrive after the exam starts,
you will not be allowed to take it.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
This will be a closed book, closed notes exam.
Calculators, phones, augmented reality glasses, laptops, and tablets
are neither needed nor permitted. If you have
these devices, you must turn them off, put them out
of sight, and not
access them for the duration of the exam.
</p>
<p>
No other electronic devices are permitted 
except for hearing aids, pacemakers,
electronic nerve stimulators, 
other implanted medical devices,
or electronic watches that function only as timekeeping devices
or chronographs.

</a>
</div>
<p>
Bring a couple of pens or pencils with you.
An extra pencil is affordable fault tolerance.
If you want to splurge, the <a href="http://amzn.com/B006YYPIUI/?tag=opk-20">Palomino Blackwing 602</a>
is considered by many to be one of the finest pencils available. The company
advertises its key virtue as "half the pressure, twice the speed." If that 
claim is really true, using this product might help you complete the exam quicker.
If you do not choose bring several extra pencils, you may want to bring a pencil sharpener. Palamino makes
a companion <a href="http://amzn.com/B009EUH8UC/?tag=opk-20">Blackwing Long Point Sharpener</a>. 
This, too, is pricey at $11.00. For a bit less money, you can get what looks like a clone: the
<a href="http://amzn.com/B0084F7I1C/?tag=opk-20">Alvin Kum Long Point Pencil Sharpener</a>. 
Both of these feature two-step sharpening: one for the wood case and another for the graphite
core of the pencil.
A truly beautiful sharpener is the 
<a href="http://amzn.com/B002Q7V4YG/?tag=opk-20">El Casco Pencil Sharpener</a>, but bringing this 
to class is really overkill, as is spending over $300 on a pencil sharpener.
If you would like to learn the craft of pencil sharpening, there are several
books available. The best of these may be 
<a href="http://amzn.com/1612193269/?tag=opk-20">
<em>How to Sharpen Pencils: A Practical & Theoretical Treatise on the Artisanal Craft of Pencil Sharpening for Writers, Artists, Contractors, Flange Turners, Anglesmiths, & Civil Servants</em></a>
by David Rees.
Do not be intimidated by the omission of "students" in the title.
You can read more about it at <a href="http://www.artisanalpencilsharpening.com">artisinalpencilsharpening.com</a>.
A video by David Rees is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spMaP-_Cq_8">here</a>.
You are welcome to bring a full pencil sharpening travel kit to the exam but be aware that a proper sharpening 
routine may consume too much time during the exam and may be messy.

<p>
I've prepared a <a href="study-guide-final.html">study guide</a>
that attempts to cover most of the material you should know.
This is a concatenation of the previous
three study guides.
It is not a substitute for the textbook and other lecture materials.
My goal has been to put most of the information you need to know in as
concise a form as possible, with more elaboration in areas where
textbook coverage may be lacking.
