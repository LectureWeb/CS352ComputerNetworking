<h1> My work</h1>
<h2> Paul Krzyzanowski&#8217;s projects</h2>
</div>

<p>
You can take a look at a list of my
<a href="pubs.html">patents &amp; publications</a>. Please contain your excitement!
</p>
<p>
I currently work at <a href="http://www.xevo.com">Xevo Inc.</a>, a global leader in data-driven user experiences
for the automotive and cruise industries. 
Now we are at the leading edge of the biggest change in automotive technology as we introduce
AI into vehicles, not just for autonomous driving but also for improving driver safety and the
infotainment experience. Since a car will never have the computing power of the cloud, we
create an environment where machine learning models run at the edge (in the car) and selectively
upload data to the cloud. Machine learning models are developed and tested in the cloud, with new
models pushed back to the edge.
</p>
<p>
My reasearch interests are in operating systems, mobile computing
(including wireless networking, and computing in disconnected and
loosely connected environments), computer system architecture, and
playing with cool and/or cute hardware and software.
</p>
<p>
These are a few of the larger or more interesting projects that I've worked on. Most
were during my time at Bell Labs research:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>	Kernel-less operating systems </dt>
	<dd> Operating systems take on quite a lot of work. Even
	microkernel systems take on quite a bit of responsibility
	in providing rudimentary I/O access, process scheduling,
	and resource management. Can we make things even simpler?
	This project created a "kernel" whose entire role is merely
	switching execution between protected spaces. Basically,
	each "process" requests a certain amount of memory and
	gets a protected address space <i>and</i> an interrupt
	table. The mechanism for switching between these spaces is
	by invoking the appropriate interrupt. Some spaces may	
	have the privileges to operate in kernel mode or to access
	certain devices. All that the kernel does is accept the
	traps and perform this extended context switch to a new
	protected domain. It was sad to see how long the interrupt
	latency on an intel Pentium-class CPU was, largely due to the
	fact that the processor doesn't support tagged TLBs in its MMU.
	</dd>

<dt>	Wireless ATM networking  </dt>
	<dd> We built a small circuit board that contains a wireless modem, microprocessor,
	and a bunch of memory and is interfaced via a PCMCIA interface. This system
	formed the basis of a wireless ATM network.  The interesting part was
	getting quality-of-service reservations to work well.  In the wireless
	world, we were faced with a bandwidth considerably lower than one typically
	gets in the wired world and, worse yet, periods of disconnection.
	We designed drivers to handle service reservation requests and provide
	the ability to interrupt applications to tell them if reservations
	can no longer be met. This allows for quality of service control and
	for applications to be self-adjusting to changes in operating conditionss.
	</dd>

<dt>	TeleWeb - Web surfing anytime, anywhere </dt>
	<dd> We like to web surf, but are not always connected to the
	Internet. Sometimes we could connect but it would be over a slow
	and/or expensive connection (e.g. dial-up modem or an airplane phone).
	TeleWeb runs as a local proxy that can make you aware (if you choose)
	of what is cached and what isn't by rewriting web pages on the fly.
	If you are not connected or connected over a costly link, TeleWeb
	will intercept access to non-cached pages and ask you whether you
	really want to load the page or if you'd like to put it in a queue
	that will be processed when you're on a better connection.  Each page
	also gives you a small bar of buttons that enables you to turn
	a few TeleWeb options on or off, and schedule timed events via
	a VCR-style timer (great for precaching pages over a slow connection).
	</dd>

<dt>	Programming your telephone  </dt>
	<dd> Telephones used to be simple. Now they're not.
	All too often you'll hear someone say "I'll try to transfer
	you but here's the number in case it doesn't work".
	We also want conferencing and call screening and possibly
	custom features. Many office phones
	are essentially simple terminals. The user interface parts
	(display, buttons, ringing) can be dissociated from the
	signalling information (ISDN or SIP). What I did was separate
	the signalling and the user interface and have a computer
	snoop on both and control the UI.
	You can now set up a call screening file which tells the
	computer what the phone (and the computer) should do for
	particular incoming calls. You can also write little scripts
	to do things like "keep dialing this number until someone answers"
	or "conference in a new user". Click to dial becomes really
	simple and does what you want &mdash; it dials the phone.
	</dd>

<dt>	Personal mobile terminal </dt>
	<dd> This research was putting a new spin on an old idea - the dumb
	terminal. This time the terminal is a Walkman-size handheld
	device containing a large LCD display, a few buttons, a microphone
	and a speaker, and a barcode reader. It has a radio interface
	and communicates with a nearby host. The personal mobile
	terminal (PMT) sends messages such as "here's some voice data",
	"button 2 was pressed", or "here's a barcode scan". It receives
	messages containing audio and display directives.
	The server is <em>entirely</em> responsible for the PMT's functionality
	as perceived by its user. For example, a user may go into a record
	store and use the barcode scanner to scan CD barcodes to be
	presented with a menu of preview choices. The same PMT may be
	taken to a warehouse and used for inventory control. It may
	be taked to a supermarket, allowing the customer to scan
	products for information and use the on-screen display to
	get information on sales. The same device can also be used for
	guided tours. Simple yet amazingly powerful.
	</dd>

<dt>	High-definition TV </dt>
	<dd> My contribution to this project was mininscule, but
	when the computer systems research lab committed to building
	an HDTV prototype (to compete for the FCC HDTV standard)
	many of us had to help out.  Having lost most of my hardware
	design skills, I worked on writing software for the
	perceptual coder and the motion estimator. This was later
	used to validate the custom HDTV hardware. Perceptual
	coding deals with the realization that you can compress
	an image only so far by squeezing out redundancy. After
	that, you have to introduce noise into the system. The
	question is where to put the noise so that it is least
	perceived by the human viewer?  Our system was based on
	taking a DCT (discrete cosine transform) and applying
	perceptual weights to the resulting matrix. The second
	component of HDTV was motion estimation. This involved
	splitting the image into a number of rectangular chunks
	and comparing each chunk with a previous frame. If a match
	is found, then the image in the chunk need not be sent
	and we only need to send the ID and a vector telling the
	receiver where that chunk is currently located. Motion
	estimation itself was a two-step process, with an initial search
	for big chunks (coarse) and a second search for small
	image chuncks (fine).
	</dd>
	
<dt>	Intelligent memory </dt>
	<dd> In the computer systems research laboratory, I worked on
	exploring the concept of <em>intelligent memory</em>. The bandwidth
	between memory and the CPU has not been increasing as rapidly
	as the two components it connects. Cache memory is a great
	solution, but it does not solve the problem completely. Sometimes
	large linked lists or other structures without spatial locality
	must be traversed or several CPUs need access to the same synchronous
	memory. The SWIM (Structured Wafer-based Intelligent Memory)
	project was our attempt at building a smarter memory chip.
	Instead of having a memory chip sit idle or serve a word of memory
	at a time, we augmented it with a <em>small</em> processor, optimized
	for memory-intensive operations. Now operations such as list
	traversals, pattern searches, and even disk I/O can be done by
	the memory without wasting bandwidth on the bus. 
	</dd>

<dt>	Exploiting program parallelism - dynamically at the object level</dt>
	<dd> 
	Writing parallel programs is difficult. Having a compiler discover
	parallelism is also difficult. This experiment focussed on 
	exploiting object level parallelism. Suppose you have an environment
	where each object can be loaded on a different processor (in
	this case, intelligent memory was used). Executing a method
	now becomes analogous to a remote procedure call.
	However, if there is no immediate need for the return value,
	the program can continue running.  Each method can do the same
	kind of aggressive scheduling.
	We run into problems when a method starts using future results.
	To handle this, all method invocations go to a commit manager
	which ensures serializability. No method will commit unless
	it gets an OK from the commit manager. We ensure serializability
	and achieve optimal object-level parallelism.
	</dd>

<dt>	Parallel computing </dt>
	<dd>
	We built a machine named SMOKE, optimized for parallel numeric
	processing. I wrote a C compiler for this system as well as
	other tools to enable applications to be written for this. The architecture was
	a grid topology (4-way communication) with half the address space
	of each processor being global shared memory and
	the other half local to a processor.
	</dd>

<dt>	Unix </dt>
	<dd> I spent the first several years of my Bell Labs career working
	in the Unix System lab.
	My work focussed on the initial development of remote file sharing 
	and on writing the administrative commands for distributed
	file systems for system V release 4 (share, /etc/dfs, and all that
	crud). After that, I developed an
	intelligent consultant for system administration (no - nothing as
	demeaning as the Microsoft paper clip!). I also played with
	high-speed regular expression parsers and rule-based email systems.
	</dd>
