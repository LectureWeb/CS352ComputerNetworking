<p>Hardly a day goes by when the news doesn&#8217;t touch upon some aspect of
computer security: stolen passwords, compromised bank accounts, phishing
attacks, or private communications. The security landscape is getting
broader with the inclusion of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles,
microprocessor-controlled medical implants, and home security systems.</p>

<h1 id="thecourse">the course</h1>

<p>As its name - 01:198:419 - implies, this course is about Computer Security.</p>

<p>The topic of computer security is too broad for one course but we will
cover a lot of the big areas: operating system security models and where
they fail, programmer errors, sandboxing, network defenses, and particular
issues related to commerce and mobility.</p>

<p>A tentative syllabus can be found at
<a href="./syllabus.html">syllabus.html</a>.
The course content will likely change throughout the semester.
This is my first time teaching this course and I am trying to group
topics into sensible categories and into an order that does not require
forward dependencies. However, I don&#8217;t yet have a good idea of how much
time some topics may take, so I may stretch some out or add new topics in.
I will update the web pages as the course progresses.</p>

<p>Course information can be found on my main course web page
<a href="index.html">http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/\~pxk/419</a>.
The links on that page will take you to prerequisites,
homework assignments, exam info, and course policy.
Be sure to check out the policy and prerequisites at the
start of the course to avoid problems.
The link at the bottom will take you to a
<a href="news.html">news</a>
page (the link text will state when it was updated). This
contains a running list of announcements such as
homework assignments, exam announcements, corrections, and
random comments. Please make a point of checking this
page.</p>

<h1 id="lecturenotes">lecture notes</h1>

<p>The course will use on-line reading material.
We will make much use of Ross Anderson&#8217;s
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html">Security Engineering</a>, second
edition, which is available online or <a href="http://amzn.to/2jGNvb0">in print form</a>.
We will also make use of published papers and other contet.
I will post lecture notes that summarize lecture content, particularly
information that may not be available in the text.
While the lecture notes attempt to cover most material that
will be presented, I cannot guarantee that they will cover all
of the material. The course is not a correspondence course.
<strong>You are responsible for attending class
and for all the material presented in class</strong>. </p>

<h1 id="examsandassignments">exams and assignments</h1>

<p>In order for me to be able to give you a grade in this course, you will
have a number of homework assignments, programming projects, exams,
and quizzes. My goal is not to torture you but to give you an
opportunity to play with some of the material presented and
for me to get enough material from you so that I can give you a
fair grade without your performance being determined by a single exam.</p>

<p>I expect that you have reasonable proficiency in programming in C
and/or Java and/or Python.
You cannot pass the course without completing the programming
assignments. There will be an exam given roughly every third
lecture for half a lecture along with a final exam. All exams
will be weighted equally and the lowest grade will be dropped.
My hope is that enough of you will do well in the course that you
will not have to take the final exam. Largely to reward attendance
and to ensure that you&#8217;re not completely asleep (since it is a late
class), I will gived a few quizzes throughout the semester. These will be intended to
be quite easy and you will be able to complete them during the lecture
using information obtained from the lecture.</p>
