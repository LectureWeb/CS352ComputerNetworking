<h1> Distributed Transactions </h1>
<h2> ACID, Commit protocols, and BASE</h2>
<p class="author"> Paul Krzyzanowski </p>
<p class="date"> November 2012 (major updates from October 2007) </p>
</div>

<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p>
We've looked at a number of low level techniques that can
be used for managing synchronization in a distributed environment:
algorithms for mutual exclusion and critical section management.
In addition (and we'll look at these later), we can have algorithms
for deadlock resolution and crash recovery. 
Much as remote procedure calls allowed us to concentrate on the
functionality of a program and express it in a more natural way
than sends and receives, we crave a higher level of abstraction
in dealing with issues of synchronization. This brings us to the
topic of <strong>atomic transactions</strong> (also known colloquially simply
as <strong>transactions</strong>).
</p>

<p>
In transacting business, all parties involved may have to go through
a number of steps in negotiating a contract but the end result of
the transaction won't be <em>committed</em> until both parties sign on
the dotted line.  If even one of the parties reconsiders and <em>
aborts</em>, the contract will be forgotten and life goes on as before.
</p>

<p>
Consider, for example, the purchase of a house.
You express your interest in purchasing a house by making an offer
(and possibly putting some money down with a trusted party). At that
point, you have not bought the house, but you have entered the
transaction of purchasing a house. You may have things to do
(such as getting a mortgage and inspection) and the seller may have
things to do (such as fixing up certain flaws).  If something goes
wrong (you can't get a mortgage, the seller won't fix the heating
system, you find the house is sitting on a fault line, the seller
won't remove the black velvet wallpaper, ...), then the transaction
is cancelled (<em>aborted</em>) and both parties go back to life as
before: you look for another house and the seller remains in the
house, possibly still trying to sell it.  If, however, the 
transaction is not aborted and both parties sign the contract on
the closing day, it is made permanent. The deed is signed over and
you own the house. If the seller changes her mind at this point,
she'll have to try to buy back the house. If you change your mind,
you'll have to sell the house.
</p>

<p>
The concept of a transaction in the realm of computing is
quite similar. One process announces that it's beginning a transaction
with one or more processes. Certain actions take place. When <em>all</em>
processes <strong>commit</strong>, the results are permanent. Until they
do so, any process may <strong>abort</strong> (if something fails, for example).
In that case, the state of computing reverts to the state before
the transaction began: all side effects are gone. A transaction has
an <em>all or nothing</em> property.
</p>

<p>
The origins of transactions in computing date back to the days
of batch jobs scheduled to processes tapes. A days worth of "transactions"
would be logged on a tape. At the end of the day, a merge job would
be run with the original database tape and the transactions tape
as inputs, producing a new tape with all the transactions applied.
If anything went wrong, the original database tape was unharmed.
If the merge succeeded, then the original tapes could be reused.
</p>

<h1> Transaction model </h1>

<p>
A process that wishes to use transactions must be aware of certain
<strong>primitives</strong> associated with them. These primitives are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>	<em>begin transaction</em> - mark the start
<li>	<em>end transaction</em> - mark the end; try to commit
<li>	<em>abort transaction</em> - kill transaction, restore old values
<li>	<em>read</em> data from object(file), <em>write</em> data to object(file).
</ol>
<p>
In addition, ordinary statements, procedure calls, etc. are allowed in
a transaction.
</p>
<p>
To get a flavor for transactions, consider booking a flight from
Newark, New Jersey to Ridgecrest, California. The destination requires
us to land at Inyokern airport, and non-stop flights are not available:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<u>transaction begin</u>
1. reserve a seat for Newark to Denver (EWK&rarr;DEN)
2. reserve a seat for Denver to Los Angeles (DEN&rarr;LAX)
3. reserve a seat for Los Angeles to Inyokern (LAX&rarr;IYK)
<u>transaction end</u>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Suppose there are no seats available on the LAX&rarr;IYK leg
of the journey. In this case, the transaction is aborted, reservations
for (1) and (2) are undone, and the system reverts to the state before
the reservation was made.
</p>

<h1> Properties of transactions </h1>

<p>
The properties of transactions are summarized with the acronym
<strong>ACID</strong>, which stands for <strong>A</strong>tomic,
<strong>C</strong>onsistent, <strong>I</strong>solated, and
<strong>D</strong>urable.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>	<u><strong>Atomic</strong></u>
	<dd> either an entire transaction happens completely or not at all. If
	the transaction does happen, it happens as a single <em>indivisible</em>
	action. Other processes cannot see intermediate results.
	For example, suppose we have a file that is 100 bytes long and a transaction
	begins appending to it. If other processes read the file, they only see
	the 100 bytes. At the end of the transaction, the file <em>instantly</em>
	grows to its new size.
<dt>	<u><strong>Consistent</strong></u>
	<dd> If the system has certain invariants, they must hold after the
	transaction (although they may be broken within the transaction).
	For example, in some banking application, the invariant may be that
	the amount of money before a transaction must equal the amount of money
	after the transaction. Within the transaction, this invariant may be
	violated but this is not visible outside the transaction.
<dt>	<u><strong>Isolated</strong></u> (or <strong>serializable</strong>)
	<dd> If two or more transactions are running at the same time, to each
	of them and to others, the <em>final result</em> looks as though all transactions
	ran sequentially in <em>some</em> order.
	<p>
	An order of running transactions is called a <strong>schedule</strong>. Orders may be
	interleaved. If no interleaving is done and the transactions are run in
	some sequential order, they are <strong>serialized</strong>.
	<p>
	Consider the following three (small) transactions:
	<table border=0>
	<td><pre>
begin
x=0
x=x+1
end</pre>
	<td><pre>
begin
x=0
x=x+2
end</pre>
	<td><pre>
begin
x=0
x=x+3
end</pre>
	</table>
	Some possible schedules are (with time flowing from left to right):
	<table border=1>
	<td> <em>schedule</em> <td colspan=6> <em>execution order</em>  <td> final x <td> legal?
	<tr>
	<td> schedule 1 <td> x=0 <td> x=x+1 <td> x=0 <td> x=x+2 <td> x=0 <td> x=x+3 <td> 3 <td> yes
	<tr>
	<td> schedule 1 <td> x=0 <td> x=0 <td> x=x+1 <td> x=x+2 <td> x=0 <td> x=x+3 <td> 3 <td> yes
	<tr>
	<td> schedule 1 <td> x=0 <td> x=0 <td> x=x+1 <td> x=0 <td> x=x+2 <td> x=x+3 <td> 5 <td> NO
	</table>
<dt>	<u><strong>Durable</strong></u>
	<dd> Once a transaction <strong>commits</strong>, the results are made <strong>permanent</strong>.
	No failure after a commit can undo results or cause them to get lost. [Conversely,
	the results are <em>not</em> permanent until a transaction commits.]
</dl>

<h1> Nested transactions </h1>

<p>
Transactions may themselves contain subtransactions (nested transactions). A top-level transaction
may fork off children that run in parallel with each other. Any or all of these may execute 
subtransactions. 
</p>

<p>
The problem with this is that the subtransactions may commit but, later in time, the parent may
abort.  Now we find ourselves having to undo the committed transactions.  The level of nesting
(and hence the level of undoing) may be arbitrarily deep.  For this to work, conceptually,
each subtransaction must be given a <em>private copy of every object</em> it may manipulate.
On commit, the private copy displaces its parent's universe (which may be a private copy of
that parent's parent).
</p>

<h1> Implementation </h1>

<p>
We cannot just allow a transaction to update the objects
(files, DB records, et cetera)
that it uses.
The transactions won't be atomic (i.e., appear indivisible)
or consistent in that case. If other transactions read and
act on the data, we also violate the isolated property.
Finally, we need to ensure that we can undo changes if the
transaction aborts.
One way of supporting object modification
is by providing a <strong>private workspace</strong>. When a process starts
a transaction, it's given a private workspace containing all the
objects to which it has access.  On a commit, the private workspace
becomes the real workspace.  Clearly this is an expensive proposition.
It requires us to copy everything that the transaction may modify
(every file, for example).  However, it is not as bleak
as it looks. A number of optimizations can make this a feasible solution.
</p>

<p>
Suppose that a process (transaction) reads a file but doesn't modify it. In
that case it doesn't need a copy.  The private workspace can be empty except that
it contains a pointer back to the parent's workspace.  How about writing a
file?  On an open, don't copy the file to the private workspace but just copy
the index (information of where the file's data is stored; a UNIX inode, for example).
The file is then read in the usual way. When a block is modified, a local copy
is made and the address for the copied block is inserted into the index. New
blocks (appends) work this way too.  Privately allocated blocks are called
<strong>shadow blocks</strong>.
</p>

<p>
If this transaction was to abort, the private blocks  go back on the free list
and the private space is cleaned up. Should the transaction commit, the private
indices are moved into the parent's workspace (atomically). Any parent blocks
that would be overwritten are freed.
</p>

<p>
Another, and more popular,  mechanism for ensuring that transactions
can be undone (and possibly redone) is the use of a <strong>write-ahead
log</strong>, also known as an <strong>intentions list</strong>.  With this system,
objects are modified in place (proper locking should be observed
to control when other processes can access these objects). Before any data
is changed, a record is written to the
write-ahead log in <strong>stable storage</strong>.  The record identifies
the transaction (with an ID number), the block or page modified,
and the old and new values. This log allows us to undo the
effects of a transaction should an <em>abort</em> be necessary.
</p>

<p>
If the transaction succeeds (i.e., commits), a commit record is written to the log.
If the transaction aborts, the log is used to back up to the original state (this
is called a <strong>rollback</strong>. The write-ahead log can also be played forward for
crash recovery (this becomes useful in the two-phase commit protocol, which is
discussed next).  A term associated with the write-ahead log was <strong>stable storage</strong>.
This is intended to be a data repository that can survive system crashes. After
a datum is written to stable storage, it is retrievable even if the system crashes
immediately after the write.  A disk is suitable for stable storage, but it is
important that any writes are immediately flushed to the disk and not linger in
the memory (unstable) buffer cache.
</p>

<h1>The two-phase commit protocol </h1> (Gray, 1978)

<p>
In a distributed system, a transaction may involve multiple
processes on multiple machines.  Even in this environment, we
still need to preserve the properties of transactions and
achieve an atomic commit (either all processes involved in
the transaction commit or else all of them will abort the
transaction - it will be unacceptable to have some commit and
some abort).  A protocol that achieves this atomic commit
is the <strong>two-phase commit protocol</strong>.
</p>

<p>
In implementing this protocol, we assume that one process will function
as the coordinator and the rest as cohorts (the coordinator may be the
one that initiated the transaction, but that's not necessary). We further
assume that there is stable storage and a write-ahead log at each site.
Furthermore, we assume that no machine involved crashes forever.
</p>

<p>
The protocol works as follows (the coordinator is ready to
commit and needs to ensure that everyone else will do so as well):
</p>
<blockquote>
    <table frame=box border=2 frame=border>
	<td> <em> phase </em> <td> <em>coordinator</em> </td> <td> <em>cohort</em> </td> 
	<tr>
	<td align=center valign=center rowspan=4> 1 <br> <em>request</em> </td>
	    <td> write <em>prepare to commit</em> message to the log </td>
		<td> work on transaction; when done, wait for a <em>prepare</em> message </td>
	<tr>
	    <td> send <em>prepare to commit</em> message </td>
		<td> </td>
	<tr>
	    <td rowspan=2> wait for reply </td>
		<td> receive message. When transaction is ready to commit,
		     write <em>agree to commit</em> (or <em>abort</em>) to log. </td>
	<tr>
	    
		<td> send "agree" or "abort" reply </td>
	<tr>
	<td align=center valign=center rowspan=5> 2 <br> <em>commit</em> </td>
	    <td> write <em>commit</em> message to the log. </td>
		<td> <em>wait for commit message </em> </td>
	<tr>
	    <td> send <em>commit</em> (or <em>abort</em>) message </td>
		<td> receive <em>commit</em> (or <em>abort</em>) message</td>
	<tr>
	    <td rowspan=2> wait for <em>all</em> cohorts to respond </td>
		<td> if a <em>commit</em> was received, write "commit"
		     to the log, release all locks & resources, update
		     databases. <br>
		     if an <em>abort</em> was received, undo all changes. </td>
	<tr>
		<td> send <em>done</em> message. </td>
	<tr>
	    <td> clean up all state. Done. </td>
		<td> </td>
	</tr>
    </table>
</blockquote>

<p>
What the two phase commit protocol does is this:
</p>
<p>
In phase 1, the coordinator
sends a request to commit to all the cohorts and waits for a reply from <em>all</em>
of them.  The reply is either an agreement or an abort. Note that nobody
has committed at this point. After the coordinator receives a reply from
all cohorts, it knows that all transaction-relevant computation is finished
so nothing more will happen to abort the transaction.  The transaction
can now be committed or, in the case that at lease one of the parties
could not complete its transaction, aborted.  The second phase is to wait
for all cohorts to commit (or abort).  If aborting, an abort message is
sent to everyone. The coordinator waits until <em>every</em> cohort responds
with an acknowledgement.  If committing, a cohort receives a <em>commit</em>
message, commits locally, and sends an acknowledgment back. All message deliveries
are reliable (retransmits after time-out).
</p>

<p>
No formal proof will be given here of the correctness of the two-phase protocol.
Inspecting for correctness, it is readily apparent that if one cohort completes
the transaction, <em>all</em> cohorts will complete if eventually. If a cohort
is completing a transaction, it is because it received a <em>commit</em> message,
which means that we're in the commit phase and <em>all</em> cohorts have
agreed. This information is in permanent memory in case of a crash (that's
why information is written to the log before a message is sent.  If any system
crashes, it can replay its log to find its latest state (so it will know if it
was ready to commit, for example). When the coordinator is completing, it is
ensured that <em>every</em> cohort completes before the coordinator's data
is erased(update).
</p>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h1>Three-Phase Commit</h1>
<p>
A problem with the two-phase commit protocol is that there
is no time limit for the protocol to complete. A sub-transaction may
be delayed indefinitely or the process (or machine) may die and it might
be a long time before it restarts.
If the coordinator dies, there is no easy way for a standby coordinator
to find out the state of the protocol and continue the commit.
From a practical point of view, this
is not good.
</p>
<p>
The <em>three-phase commit protocol</em> is a variation of the two-phase commit
protocol that places an upper bound on the time that a transaction
may take to commit or abort. It also introduces an extra phase
where cohorts are told what the consensus was so that any of them
that received this information before a coordinator died
could inform a standy coordinator whether there was a unanimous
decision to commit or abort.
</p>
<p>
The setup is the same as with the two-phase commit protocol.
A coordinator process is in charge of soliciting votes from multiple
cohorts that are responsible for the various sub-transactions of the
top-level transaction. Here are the steps:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <table frame=box border=2 frame=border>
	<td> <em> phase </em> <td> <em>coordinator</em> </td> <td> <em>cohort</em> </td> 
	<tr>
	<td align=center valign=center rowspan=4> 1 <br> <em>request</em> </td>
	    <td> write <em>prepare to commit</em> message to the log </td>
		<td> work on transaction; when done, wait for a <em>prepare</em> message </td>
	<tr>
	    <td rowspan=2> send <em>prepare to commit</em> message </td>
		<td> receive message. When transaction is ready to commit,
		     write <em>agree to commit</em> (or <em>abort</em>) to log. </td>
		</tr><tr>
		<td> if timeout on waiting for a <em>prepare</em> message, then abort</td>
	<tr>
	    <td> wait for reply from all cohorts.
	    </td>
		<td> </td>
	</tr> <tr>


	<td align=center valign=center rowspan="4"> 2 <br> <em>commit authorized</em> </td>
		<td>
		if all replies have been received and all replies are "agree" messages, then
		write <em>prepare-to-commit</em>  message to the log.
		<br/>
		else if all replies are not received before a timeout or at least a
		single <em>abort</em> message is received then
		write an <em>abort</em> message to the log.
		</td>

		<td> wait for a <em>prepare-to-commit</em> or <em>abort</em> message </td>
	</tr><tr>

		<td rowspan=2>
		send a <em>prepare-to-commit</em> or <em>abort</em> message to all cohorts.
		</td>

		<td> If the cohort receives a <em>prepare-to-commit</em> message, it 
		sends back an acknowledgement and waits. The commit does not yet
		take place.
		</tr><tr>
		<td>
		If the cohort receives an <em>abort</em> message or
		times out waiting for a message from the coordinator, then
		it aborts the transaction. This means that it
		  releases all locks & resources, and reverts the state of the data it modified.
		</td>
	</tr><tr>
	    <td> if a <em>prepare-to-commit</em> was sent, then wait for all cohorts to respond.
		<br/> otherwise, we're done. </td>
		<td> </td>
	</tr><tr>

	<td align=center valign=center rowspan="5"> 3 <br> <em>commit finalized</em> </td>
	    <td> write <em>commit</em> message to the log. </td>
		<td> <em>wait for a commit message </em> </td>
	<tr>
	    <td rowspan=2> send <em>commit</em>  message </td>
		<td> receive a <em>commit</em>. 
		     release all locks & resources, make database changes permanent.
			<br/>
			if a timeout on waiting for a <em>commit</em> message, then commit anyway.
		</td>
		</tr><tr>
		<td> send a <em>commit completed</em> message.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td> Receive <em>commit completed</em> messages from all cohorts. Give up
		waiting after a certain time.</td>
		<td> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td> clean up all state. Done. </td>
		<td> </td>
	</tr>
    </table>
</blockquote>

If the coordinator crashes during this protocol, another
one can step in and query the cohorts for the commit decision.
If every cohort received the <em>prepare-to-commit</em>
message then the coordinator can commit. If only some cohorts received
the message, the coordinator now knows that the unanimous
decision was to commit and can re-issue the request. If 
no cohort received the message, the coordinator can
restart to protocol or, if necessary, restart the transaction.


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h1>Paxos Commit</h1>
<p>
</em>What's wrong with the two-phase commit protocol?</em>
</p>
<p>
The problem with the two-phase commit protocol is that it requires
all systems to be available in order to complete.
A single fault can make the two-phase commit protocol block. Two-phase
commit is not fault tolerant because it uses a single coordinator
whose failure can cause the protocol to block.
</p>
<p>
<em>What about three-phase commit?</em>
</p>
<p>
Three-phase commit tries to solve this with timeouts but no
implementations have been put forth with a truly complete algorithm
with a correctness proof. If the three-phase commit protocol
implements voting for a coordinator, a key problem with the algorithm
is that it is undefined what happens when a resource manager
(the cohort, responsible for a sub-transaction) receives messages from two
different processes; both claiming to be the current transaction
manager (coordinator).
</p>
<p>
<em>Can we get ACID guarantees that we want and still survive F faults?</em>
</p>
<p>
Fault-tolerant consensus algorithms such as Paxos are designed to
reach agreement and do not block whenever any majority of the
processes are working.

Let's use Paxos to create a fault-tolerant commit protocol that
uses multiple coordinators. A majority of functioning coordinators
will allow the commit to occur.
</p>

<p>
The participants in the algorithm are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
N resource managers (RMs). Each resource manager is associated with
a single sub-transaction. For the transaction to be committed, each
participating resource manager must be willing to commit it.
</li><li>
2F+1 acceptors, where F is the number of failures that we can
tolerate. If F+1 acceptors see that all resource managers are
prepared then then transaction can be committed. All instances of
Paxos can share the same set of acceptors. 
</li><li>
a Leader. The leader coordinates the commit algorithm. All instances
of Paxos share the same leader. Unlike the two-phase commit, it is
not a single point of failure.
</li><li>
One instance of the Paxos consensus algorithm is executed for each
resource manager. Each instance provides a fault-tolerant way to
agree on the commit or abort proposed by each resource manager: each
resource manager is responsible for a sub-transaction.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here's how we run the algorithm:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
A client requests a commit by sending a commit request to a transaction
manager. The Paxos Commit algorithm uses a separate instance of the
Paxos consensus algorithm to obtain agreement on the decision each
RM makes of whether to prepare (commit) or abort. We can represent
this decision by unique values that represent <em>Prepared</em> and <em>Aborted</em>,
respectively. The transaction will be committed if and only if each
resource manager's instance chooses <em>Prepared</em>. Otherwise, the
transaction is aborted.
</li>
<li>
The transaction manager sends a <em>PREPARE</em> message to each resource manager.
</li>
<li>
Each resource manager then sends a proposal to its own consensus
algorithm (running on multiple servers). Each resource manager is
the first proposer in its own instance of Paxos.
</li>
<li>
Each instance of the consensus algorithm sends the results back to the transaction manager.
</li>
<li>
The transaction manager is stateless and just gets consensus outcomes.
It will issue a <em>COMMIT</em> or <em>ABORT</em> message to each resource manager
based on whether it received any <em>ABORT</em> messages.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As long as the majority of acceptors are working, the transaction
manager can always learn what was chosen. If it fails to hear from
all the resource managers then it can make the decision to abort.
Paxos maintains consistency, never allowing two different values
to be chosen, even if multiple processes think they are the leader.
</p>
<p>
Paxos provides a fault-tolerant commit algorithm based on replication.
With two-phase commit, you rely on the coordinator to not fail or
to recover after a failure. With Paxos Commit, the two-phase commit's
transaction manager's stable storage is replaced by the acceptor's stable
storage. The transaction manager itself is replaced with a set of
possible leaders. With two-phase commit, the transaction manager
is solely responsible for deciding whether to abort. With Paxos
Commit, a leader will make an abort decision only for a resource
manager that cannot decide for itself (e.g., it is not functioning).
This will ensure that the protocol will not block due to a failed
resource manager.

<h1> Brewer's CAP Theorem </h1>
<p>
Eric Brewer proposed a conjecture that states that if
you want consistency, availability, and partition tolerance, you
have to settle for two out of three for any shared data system.
This assertion as since been proven and Brewer's proposal
is known as <em>Brewer's CAP theorem</em>, where <em>CAP</em>
stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partitions.
Partition tolerance means that all the systems will continue
to work unless there is a total network failure. The inaccessibility
of a few notes will not impact the system. Let's examine
each of the aspects of CAP.
</p>
<dl>
<dt> Consistency </dt>
<dd>
<p>
Consistency in this discussion means that everyone sees the same
view of the data if it is replicated in a distributed system.
This can be enforced by forcing the algorithms to wait until 
all participating nodes acknowledge their actions (e.g., two phase commit).
Guaranteeing this impacts availability.
Alternatively, if we want to offer availability, we need to ensure
that all live nodes can get updated and we have to give up
on partition tolerance.
<p>
</dd>

<dt> Availability </dt>
<dd>
Availability refers to the system being highly available. Since
commodity-built individual systems are not highly available,
we achieve availability through redundancy, which means replication.
If one system is down, a request can be fulfilled by another.
In an environment with multiple systems connected on a network
we have to be concerned about network partitioning. If we
have partition tolerance, then we lose consistency: some systems
are disconnected from the network segment where updates are
being issued. Conversely, to keep consistency, we have to ensure
that the network remains fully connected so that all live nodes
can get updates. This means giving up on partition tolerance.
</dd>

<dt> Partition Tolerance</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Partition tolerance means that the system performs 
correctly even if the network gets segmented.
This can be enforced by using a non-distributed system 
(in which case partitioning is meaningless) or
by forcing the algorithms to wait until network
partitioning no longer exists (e.g., two phase commit).
Guaranteeing this impacts availability.
Alternatively, the system can continue running, but 
partitioned nodes will not participate in the computation
(e.g., commits, updates) and will hence have different values
of data, impacting consistency.
</p>
</dd>

<p>
Giving up on consistency allows us to use optimistic
concurrency control techniques as well as leases instead
of locks. Examples of this are web caches and the Domain
Name System (DNS).
</p>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h1> BASE: Giving up on ACID </h1>

<p>
Availability and partition tolerance are not part of the ACID
guarantees of a transaction, so we may be willing to give those up to 
preserve database integrity. However, that may not be the best
choice in all environments since it limits a system's ability to scale
and be highly available. In fact, in a lot of environments,
availability and partition tolerance are <em>more</em> 
important than consistency (so what if you get stale data?).
</p>

<p>
In order to guarantee ACID behavior in transactions, objects (e.g.,
parts of the database) have to be locked so that everyone will see
consistent data, which involves other entities having to wait until
that data is consistent and unlocked.

Locking works well on a small scale but is difficult to do efficiently
on a huge scale. Instead, it is attractive to consider using cached data.
The risk is that we violate the "C" and "I" in ACID (Consistent &amp; Isolated):
two separate
transactions might see different views of the same data. An example
might me that you just purchased the last copy of a book on Amazon.com
but I still see one copy remaining.
</p>

<p>
An alternative to the strict requirements of ACID is <em>BASE</em>,
which stands for <strong>B</strong>asic <strong>A</strong>vailability,
<strong>S</strong>oft-state, <strong>E</strong>ventual consistency.

Instead of requiring consistency after every transaction, it is enough
for a database to eventually be in a consistent state. In these 
environments, accessing stale data is acceptable. This leniency makes
it easy to cache copies of data throughout multiple nodes, never have
to lock access to all those copies for any extensive time (e.g., a transaction
operating on data will not lock all copies of that data), and update
that data asynchronously (eventually). With a BASE model, extremely
high scalability is obtainable through caching (replication), no
central point of congestion, and no need for excessive messages to coordinate
activity and access to data.

<h1> Some vocabulary </h1>

<dl compact>
<dt> <strong>abort</strong>
<dd>	transaction will not complete (commit). All changes are undone
	to the state before the transaction started.
<dt> <strong>commit</strong>
<dd>	action which indicates that the transaction has successfully
	completed. All changes to the database, files, and objects
	are made permanent.
<dt> <strong>commit protocol</strong>
<dd>	a fault-tolerant algorithm which ensures that all sides
	in a distributed system either commit or abort a transaction
	unanimously.
<dt> <strong>log</strong>
<dd>	a record of system activity recorded in sufficient detail so
	that a previous state of a process can be restored.
<dt> <strong>redo</strong>
<dd>	given a log record, redo the action specified in the log.
<dt> <strong>stable storage</strong>
<dd>	permanent storage to which we can do atomic writes.
<dt> <strong>transaction</strong>
<dd>	an atomic action which is some computation that read and/or
	changes the state of one or more data objects and appears
	to take place indivisibly.
<dt> <strong>write-ahead log protocol</strong>
<dd>	a method in which operations done on objects may be undone	
	after restarting a system.
