<h1> Virtualization </h1>
<h2> Virtual storage & virtual machines </h2>
<p class="author"> Paul Krzyzanowski </p>

</div>

<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p>
<strong>Virtualization</strong> is a general term for referring to presenting an abstract
view of system resources.
For example, <em>virtual memory</em> allows each process to have the illusion that it has
sole access to the processor's complete memory address space. The reality, of course, is
that multiple processes are all using different regions of the computer's memory, with
some regions moved over to the disk if there isn't enough memory for everyone.
This illusion of access to all of the memory is provided
by a processor's memory management unit (MMU), which translates <em>virtual addresses</em> 
used by the program into <em>physical addresses</em> that represent real memory locations.
</p>

<h2> Storage virtualization </h2>
<p>
<strong>Storage virtualization</strong> refers to abstracting the knowledge of physical disks from
they operating system. The disk subsystem presents the operating system with a set of 
<em>virtual disks</em>, each identified by a <em>logical unit number</em> (LUN) and containing
a set of logical block numbers. The operating system makes requests to read and write blocks
on various virtual disks. The disk subsystem converts these logical requests into physical
requests. For example, four 500 GB disks may appear to the operating system as one 2 TB disk.
The virtualization software will convert the logical block number to a read/write operation
on a physical block number for one of those four disks. A simple approach to this is to translate as follows:
</p>
<pre>
blocks_per_disk = 500 GB / block_size;
physical_disk_number = logical_block / blocks_per_disk;
physical_block_number = logical_block - (physical_disk number * blocks_per_disk);
</pre>

<p>
Physical storage can also be split up instead of aggregated. A 500 GB disk can be made to
appear as two 200 GB disks and one 100 GB disk.
</p>

<p>
There are several ways in which storage may be connected to computers:
</p>
<dl>
<dt> NAS (Network Attached Storage) </dt>
<dd>
NAS refers to distributed (networked) file systems, where the client operating system does not manage
the file system and its related mapping of data to disk blocks but instead makes high-level
requests for files or pieces of files from a server over a network. Storage virtualization
doesn't factor into this as far as the client is concerned because all storage is managed by the
server &mdash; it is up to the server to be configured with a specific disk architecture.
</dd>

<div class="right-sidetext">
<h1>About SCSI</h1>
<p>
SCSI is a protocol, standardized in 1986, for computers to connect to and communicate with disks.
The communication protocol allows one to send commands to logical units (identified by a
logical unit number (LUN) within a physical device. While there are about 60 commands in SCSI, the
basic ones are for reading and writing logical blocks, formatting the unit, and spinning the disk
up and down (starting/stopping).
</p>
</div>

<dt> DAS (Direct Attached Storage) </dt>
<dd>
DAS refers to storage that is directly connected to your computer, either internally via 
a SATA (serial ATA) interface or externally via USB, Firewire, and eSATA.
If virtualization is provided here, it is up to the disk controller. For example, 
devices such as the
<a href="http://www.drobo.com/Products/drobo.html" target="_blank">Data Robotics Drobo</a>
provide your computer with a view of a single Firewire- or USB-connected disk while
in reality the system manages several disks to offer expandability and fault tolerance.
</dd>

<dt> SAN (Storage Area Network) </dt>
<dd>
<p>
SANs are common in the enterprise world where it is important to be able to connect
large amounts of storage and manage that storage seperatly from the computer.
A SAN is a dedicated switched network connecting computers with storage systems.
The most common network is <em>Fibre Channel</em>, which uses optical fibers offering
gigabit speeds and sends SCSI commands to read and write blocks on disks. In
recent years, iSCSI has been rapidly gaining popularity. Instead of using the 
special-purpose cables of Fibre Channel, iSCSI uses TCP/IP to send SCSI
commands over an IP network.
</p>
<p>
A Fibre Channel switch can be configured to allow specific hosts to access only
certain disks. If we add a virtualization layer here, we can perform the types
of block translations discussed earlier, such as pooling multiple storage units
into one larger virtual storage unit or partitioning a disk into multiple smaller
virtual disks. We can also force writes to certain logical disks to be mirrored (copied
onto other disks) for fault tolerance.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2> Virtual CPU (sort of) </h2>
<p>
A simple abstraction of CPU virtualization is provided to processes by the operating system:
each process has the illusion of "owning" the CPU. This illusion is created by the operating
system process scheduler and preemption mechanism. At certain points, the process' allocated
time slice expires and the operating system will stop the current process from running, pick another
process that is ready to run, reload the memory management unit for that process' address
space, and let that process run for a while. On Linux systems, "a while" means between 10
and 300 msec, depending on the priority and interactivity level of the process.
</p>
<p>
While the process feels it owns the CPU, its access to the hardware is limited to what it
can do through the operating system. It cannot, for example, program the memory management 
unit or the system interval timer, halt the processor, access the ethernet card,
or access certain I/O ports directory.
</p>


<h2> Process virtual machine </h2>
<p>
A <strong>virtual machine</strong> is software (a <em>pseudo-machine</em> )
that interprets the instructions of some processor. Probably the earliest
of these was created in 1966: an O-code interpreter for the programming language
BCPL (the precursor of B, which was the precursor of the C programming language).
This effort was followed in 1973 by the Pascal-P compiler that generated p-code, for
a hypothetical p-machine. The most popular of these approaches is the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java programs are compiled into bytecodes for
the JVM (which does not exist physically) and interpreted by the JRE (Java Runtime
Environment).
</p>
<p>
The motivation for writing compilers to generate pseudo cade was that it takes
more effort to write code generators for lots of different architectures (the 1970s
were not the Intel monoculture we have today) than it does to write a bunch of 
interpreters that run on different platforms. For languages such as Pascal and Java,
an interpreter also makes it easier to impose real-time checks to enforce array bounds
and data types. The pseudo machines usually provided abstractions for I/O so that
the programmer would not have to program to a specific operating system's system
calls.
Finally, Java's tagline of "<em>write once, run anywhere</em>" shows
the convenience of having portable object code that runs on any system that contains
an interpreter for that machine.
</p>
<p>
These virtual machines, running a program via an interpreter were generally
designed to run a single process and not to emulate all the hardware that would be  
available on a real system. They are started by the user to execute the program
and exit when the program terminates. To distinguish them from the virtual machine model that
we discuss next, they are sometimes called <strong>process virtual machines</strong>
(even though they were never called that originally).
<h2> 

<h2> Virtual machines </h2>

<p>
Another form of virtual machine is one that allows us to run multiple operating
systems concurrently, sharing access to the physical machine resources. With
this for of virtual machine, we can partition one computer to act like several
computers, each with its own operating system (and IP address on the network). 
We can also migrate an entire OS (along with all of its applications) from one
machine to another.
</p>

<p>
To understand how this form of virtualization works, we need to consider what an
operating system does. Basically, it provides a set of interfaces (system calls)
that applications use to access system resources (file system, network, semaphores, etc.).
The operating system is just a program. It spends its time doing table look-ups, copying
blocks of data, formatting network packet headers, and other mundane tasks. Every once
in a while, however, it needs to access system hardware: to configure the memory management unit,
set a timer, set the task register, and perform certain types of input and output.
These instructions are called <strong>privileged</strong> instructions, in contrast to
all the other instructions on the processor, which are <strong>unprivileged</strong>.
To execute them, the operating system kernel runs in privileged, or <em>supervisor</em>
mode, while regular processes do not. If a regular application attemts to execute a
privileged instruction, it will generate a <em>trap</em> on many architectures.
</p>

<h3>The hypervisor, or virtual machine monitor </h3>

<p>
If we want to run a virtual operating system, we can run the operating system as a
real, regular program. The catch is that whenever the operating system needs to execute 
one of these special instructions, special software will need to catch the trap that
gets generated and emulate the instruction. This software that is in charge of
virtualization is known as the 
<strong>virtual machine monitor</strong> (<strong>VMM</strong>), or <strong>hypervisor</strong>.
Its job is to arbitrate access to physical resources and to present a set of virtual 
device interfaces to each virtual operating system. For instance, the VMM can present
a common ethernet card as a virtual (non-existant) device and translate any attempts to
send and receive ethernet packets to the real ethernet card on the machine, which is
being shared among other operating systems. Continuing with the ethernet card example, 
the VMM can program the real ethernet card to listen on several MAC (physical ethernet)
addresses. When the VMM (not any OS) gets the interrupt of an incoming ethernet packet,
it can generate a pseudo-interrupt to the operating system to whom that packet belongs so
that the operating system can process the packet. We can consider another popular device: the
disk. Multiple operating systems cannot access the disk directly since they will try to
grab the same disk blocks for different data. What the VMM can do is ensure that
each operating system uses its own partition.
</p>

<h3> Hosted versus native virtual machines </h3>
<p>
There are two configuartions in which virtual machines can run.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>hosted</strong> virtual machine is one where the system has a primary
operating system installed that has access to the raw machine (all devices, memory,
and file system). One or more <strong>guest</strong> operating systems can run
on virtual machines. An example is having a machine running Windows 7 and then
running Linux on a virtual machine. In this case, Windows owns the disk and all
devices. The VMM serves as a proxy to operations performed under Windwows. For example,
Linux may issue disk block read and write operations. The VMM converts these
low-level requests into Windows operations that seek into and read/write a file
under Windwos. To a user under Windows, the entire Linux "disk" appears as one file.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>native</strong> virtual machine is one where there is no "primary"
operating system that owns the system hardware. The hypervisor is in charge of 
access to the devices and provides each operating system drivers for an abstract
view of all the devices.
</p>

<h3>Intel ugliness</h3>
<p>
One problem with virtualization has been that the dominant processor platform, the
Intel IA-32 (x86, Pentium, ...) architecture did not support trapping of privileged 
instructions until the intruduction of the Intel Core 2 Duo processor. If a process
not running in privileged mode attempted to execute a privileged instruction 
<em>nothing would happen</em>. This means that you couldn't just run the operating 
system code as an unprivileged process and have a hypervisor trap and emulate the
special instructions. 
</p>

<p>
Two approaches were adopted for dealing with Intel (pre-Core 2 Duo) architectures:
<em>binary translation</em> and <em>paravirtualization</em>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Binary translation</strong> is an approach used by VMWare, the
most popular virtualization software for Intel platforms. This technique
pre-scans the instruction stream for code that is supposed to run in
privileged mode (kernel code) and replace privileged instructions with
traps taht the VMM can intercept. After this, code is executed at full
speed &ndash; instructions are executed by the processor and not interpreted.
Non-privileged code can simply be executed directly by the processor.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Paravirtualization</strong> is an approach used by Xen. It requires
that the operating system be modified to not use privileged instructions. Instead,
those calls are replaced with API calls to the VMM (which act like OS system calls,
causing a trap and a context switch to the VMM). This approach yields higher
performance than binary translation but requires access to the kernel source
code so that it may be modified. Hence, proprietary operating systems such as
the Windows family cannot work with paravirtualization.
</p>

<p>
Both AMD and Intel have modified their architectures to support virtualization.
Intel introduced Intel Virtual Technology with the Intel Core 2 Duo and AMD introduced
virtualization support with their Opteron processor. Certain privileged instructions
can now be intercepted as virtual machine exits to the VMM (similar to an operating
system context switch; control switches from the operating system on the virtual machine
to the virtual machine monitor). Exceptions, faults, and external interrupts are all
intercepted as virtual machine exits (transfers to the VMM). The VMM can also create
virtualizedd exceptions and faults as virtual machine entries &ndash; simulating 
an interrupt to the operating system running on a virtual machine.
</p>

<h3>Hypervisor-based rootkits</h3>
<p>
One security threat that has emerged with the introduction of virtual machine
support is that of <strong>hypervisor-based rootkits</strong>. The target machines
are those that have no virtual machine software installed but have hardware
support for virtualization. The intruding software runs as a VMM, intercepting
all privileged operations. Since it runs at a higher privilege level thant the
operating system, the operating system kernel has a very limited (and difficult)
ability to detect its presence. Meanwhile, this software that masquerades as
a VMM can intercept all disk and network operations (among other things).
