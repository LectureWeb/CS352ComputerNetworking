Reminder for those of you planning to take the
<a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/rutgers/exam/index.html">417 final exam</a>:
It takes place today from 8:00-10:00pm in our regular
classroom (Hill-009). If you did not receive an A and are <strong>not</strong>
planning on taking the final, please let me know (if you haven't already
done so) so that I can minimize the number of exams I need to print.
</dd>

<dt> May 6 </dt>
<dd>
I put up a list of <a href="exam/index.html">final exam topics</a>.
I also posted the 
<a href="notes/content/final-topics.pdf">final topics overview</a>
(<a href="notes/content/final-topics-6up.pdf">6 per page</a>)
list that we went through this past Monday.
</dd>

<dt> May 2 </dt>
<dd>
As of yesterday, you should have received your tentative final
grade - the grade that you will get if you do not take your final
exam. If you have not received this, please let me know.
</dd>

<dt> April 29 </dt>
<dd>
Assignment 6 grades are posted.
</dd>

<dt> April 29 </dt>
<dd>
Assignment 5 grades are posted.
All of your grades except for assignment 6 are posted.
If anything is missing, please let me know immediately.
</dd>

<dt> April 28 </dt>

Assignment 4 and Exam 3 grades are posted.
The class average for exam 3 was 76. The standard deviation was 16.7.
Grades ranged from a low of 24 to a high of 100.
</dd>

<dt> April 25 </dt>
<dd>
<p>
I realized that I omitted a discussion of concurrency control
in the 
<a href="exam/study-guide-3.html">study guide</a>. It has
now been added. I also enhanced the discussion of virtualization
to distinguish native versus hosted virtual machines and
binary translation versus paravirtualization.
</p>
<p>
I also expanded the lecture slides and study guide (two days ago)
to add the formal term <strong>password authentication protocol</strong>
for the common login, password authentication scheme and 
<strong>CHAP</strong> for the <em>Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol</em>. 
This is essentially the same challenge-response protocol we discussed
in class.
</p>
</dd>

<dt> April 25 </dt>
<dd>
<p>
I wrote up some notes on 
<a href="notes/content/virtualization.html">virtualization</a>
in case you want more depth than provided by the lecture slides.
Also, I added some missing links to the lectures pages
(the ones you get by clicking on topics from the syllubus or
list of exam topics). These include
<a href="notes/content/concurrency.pdf">concurrency control</a> and
<a href="notes/content/firewalls.pdf">protection & firewalls</a>.

Exam 3 will take place on Monday, April 27. To help you
prepare, check the 
<a href="exam/index.html">Exam info</a> link for a list of topics
that you should know for this exam.
You will also see a link to a
<a href="exam/study-guide-3.html">study guide</a> that provides an
overview of everything we have covered to date.
Finally, will also see links to <a href="exam/old/index.html">old exams</a>.
They should give you a good idea of what to expect on this exam.

<em>Note: I did not proofread the study guide yet and will notify you
if I post additions or corrections.</em>

For
<a href="hw/a-5.html">assignment 5</a>,
I've updated the <code>airport-locations.txt</code> file in

that were missing state names. Your code should not have to
change to handle this file.

For assignment 5, a student points out that some of my distance calculations
are incorrect. Even though we're using the same formula, some of the
results are slightly different. I still didn't track down where the mistake is.  
I <a href="hw/a-5-faq.html#accuracy">
posted his results</a> (which I believe are more correct than mine).
</dd>

<dt> April 4 </dt>
<dd>
<a href="https://secure.fas.rutgers.edu/apps/gradebook/">Grades</a>
for assignments 2 & 3 are posted.
Most of you did very well on the programming assignments (80+).
I posted
<a href="hw/programming-feedback.html">comments comprising my feedback</a>
on some common
annoyances I encountered.
Please look it over to make sure your next submissions
don't have these. Strive for a beautiful submission: the digital
equivalent of a

<dt> March 27 </dt>
<dd>
I made some minor changes to the
<a href="exam/study-guide-2.html">study guide</a>.

sentences on rotor machines (I was describing them twice), and highlighed
triple-DES.

I've added a brief synopsis of distributed 
authentication via OpenID to the 
<a href="exam/study-guide-2.html">study guide</a>.
I also expanded my

(it's still superficial but contains more detail).

<dt> March 27 </dt>
<dd>
I posted some questions and answers from last year's exam as well
as selected questions and answers from older exams. Any material that
we did not yet cover was left out.
Get the
