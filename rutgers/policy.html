<h1> Paul's rules of the game </h1>
</div>

<p class="first">
I was somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of excuses, late assignments,
and even collaborative work I encountered when I first began teaching.
To avoid any misunderstandings and confusion, I wrote 
down some rules and policies I'll follow this semester.
I hope that they make sense and you can abide by them.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt> <a name="attendance"> attendance </a></dt>
	<dd> Attendance is mandatory and expected. There is no required
	textbook for this course and much of the course material is not
	in any one text. You are responsible for the topics
	covered in class.  While I attempt to put most material on the
	web for your convenience, you are responsible for all material
	presented in class as well as announcements, assignments, and
	quizes.  In case you might miss a lecture, 
	<em>make a friend now!</em>
	While I will endeavor to keep my web page up to date, the
	lecture is your primary source of updates and information.
	Attendance may be taken and/or there may be a few quizzes
	given throughout the semester. Missing a class will have no
	detrimental effect on your grade; missing several may.
	</dd>

    <dt> <a name="exams"> exams </a></dt>
	<dd> There will be four exams in this course: three in-semester
	exams and a cumulative final.  All exams will be weighted
	equally and the lowest normalized grade will be dropped
	(see the <a href=grades.html>grades</a> page for a description
	of normalization). I will post
	grades before the final exam that factor in your grades from
	three exams. This will be your final grade if you choose not
	to take the final (the final is effectively 0 and is dropped).
	If you take the final exam, then it will serve only to displace
	an existing exam grade that is lower than your score on the final.
 	I will not reward you for the act of taking the final exam.
	<em>I will not give make-up exams or make-up assignments.</em>
	If you miss an exam then
	your grade for that exam is a 0. You will then have to take the
	final exam and the 0 grade will be dropped as the lowest 
	of the four grades.
	</dd>

    <dt> <a name="assignments"> assignments </a></dt>
	<dd> Assignments in this course will include both written
	problem-solving and question answering problems as well as
	programming projects. Both of them count in your final grade
	(although programming projects will count more). All assignments
	are due on their due date (that's the definition of a due date)
	<em> before </em> the time specified.
	Late programming assignments will <em>not</em> be accepted (even
	if you are 30 seconds late because you could not log on). Try
	to hand in your work early to avoid unforseen disasters.
	</dd>
	
    <dt> <a name="collaboration"> collaboration </a></dt>
	<dd> <em>All homework is intended to be done without consulting 
	others.</em>
	Since discussion of work with fellow students can be a valuable
	learning experience (besides, the material is so fascinating that
	you won't be able to help it), you certainly may discuss the
	topics related
	to the problems with others. This brings us to the next bullet item...
	</dd>

    <dt> <a name="cheating"> cheating </a></dt>
	<dd> Cheating will not be tolerated.  All homework assignments
	(including programming projects) and exams are to be done
	individually. If you have problems in understanding the material
	or doing an assignment, please schedule an appointment to see me. 
	<strong>If you chance cheating and get caught, you will be 
	reported to the dean and fail the course.</strong>
	It's not worth it.
	Be sure you read the
	<a href="http://teachx.rutgers.edu:80/integrity/policy.html">
	Rutgers policy on academic integrity</a>.
	It is <em>your</em> responsibility to ensure that your passwords are
	well-guarded, directories protected, and printouts do not fall into
	other hands.
	</dd>

    <dt> <a name="office"> office hours  </a></dt>
	<dd> I'm here to help you learn. If you have any questions or problems
	with the course material, assignments, or other matters in which I
	may be able to help you, feel free to contact me. You can
	send me mail 
	(I'll usually respond within a day) or schedule an appointment
	during my office hours. Don't just show up since I may not be
	there.
	</dd>

    <dt> <a name="pagers"> pagers and cell phones </a></dt>
	<dd> Ringing, beeping, or buzzing cell phones, PDAs, games, watches, and pagers
	are disruptive.  Please turn these devices off upon the start of class.
	Violators will be charged a $20 penalty for the first offense, a $40 penalty
	for the second offense and confiscation of the device.  Further offenses will
	be fined at $20&middot;<em>2</em><sup>(n-1)</sup>.
	</dd>

This is some stuff I'm throwing away. Please send me mail if you want any of it:

<ul>
<li> Belkin F1B0280-V Slimswitch data switch. This is a manual (knob) switch that switches among four DB25 connectors. I can't imagine why anyone would need this; perhaps for switching old printers. I never used it and can't remember how it ended up in my pile of junk.
