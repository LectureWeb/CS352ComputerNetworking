<h1> About the course </h1>
</div>

<h1>motivation</h1>
<p class="first">
Are you tired of being a wallflower at parties while
a scintillating conversation about Coda file caching
is going on about you? Do you feel lost  when someone
mentions protocol buffers? Do you clam up at the bar
when the discussion turns to authentication protocols?
Are you confused as to why a public key should be longer
than a symmetric key?
If so, then this course is for you!
</p>
<h1>the course</h1>
<p>
As its name - 01:198:417 - implies, this course is about distributed
systems. We will cover a broad spectrum of topics encompassing
system architecture, software abstractions, distributed
algorithms, and issues pertaining to distributed environments such
as security.  Topics will range from the theoretical to the
practical with a strong emphasis on the practical (such as
remote procedure/method calls, firewalls, distributed file systems,
clustering, authentication schemes, ...).
If you are looking for a course that will teach you how to
write applications using <small>CORBA</small> or web pages with 
<small>ASP</small> or <small>JSP</small>,
you will be disappointed.
</p>
<p>
I don't expect you to find all the material interesting but
my hope is that each student will find some subset interesting
and/or useful. If you feel that there is a pertinent area
that you would like to see covered, please let me know.
</p>
<p>
I taught this course to over 1,280 students for 22 semesters &ndash;
 every year since its inception
at Rutgers in the fall semester of 1997 (I have been teaching Operating
Systems at Rutgers since 1995).
A tentative syllabus can be found at
<a href=syllabus.html>
http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/rutgers/syllabus.html</a>.
It will most likely change somewhat since I am constantly
trying to structure the course to include relevant topics.
I will update the web page as the course progresses.
</p>
<p>
Course information can be found on my main course web page
<a href=index.html>
http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/rutgers</a>.
The links on that page will take you to prerequisites,
homework assignments, exam info, and course policy.
Be sure to check out the policy and prerequisites at the
start of the course to avoid problems.
The link at the bottom will take you to a
<a href="news.html">
news</a>
page (the link text will state when it was updated). This
page will contain a running list of announcements such as
homework assignments, exam announcements, corrections, and
random comments.  Please make a point of checking this
page.
</p>
<h1>lecture notes</h1>
<p>
There is no required textbook for the course. There
used to be (see <a href=things.html>Things you need</a>)
but most of the students in semesters felt that
the lecture notes were sufficient and much of the
material covered wasn't in the text anyway.  It's
your decision - you can give the $82 to the bookstore,
keep it, or give it to me.  I will make lecture notes (and 
other material) available in the <a href="syllabus/notes.html">
Documents</a> link.  The lecture notes have been
evolving each semester, and will continue to evolve.  Please
let me know of any errors, omissions, or unclear descriptions.
</p>
<p>
While the lecture notes attempt to cover most material that
will be presented, I cannot guarantee that they will cover all
of the material. The course is not a correspondence course.
<strong>You are responsible for attending class
and for all the material presented in class</strong>. 
</p>
<h1>exams and assignments</h1>
<p>
In order for me to be able to give you a grade in this course, you will
have a number of homework assignments, programming projects, exams,
and possibly quizzes.  My goal is not to torture you but to give you an
opportunity to play with some of the material presented and
for me to get enough material from you so that I can give you a
fair grade without your performance determined by a single exam.
</p>
<p>
Since this is a fourth year computer science class, I expect
that you have reasonable proficiency in programming in both C
and Java.
You cannot pass the course without completing the programming
assignments. There will be an exam given roughly every third
lecture for half a lecture along with a final exam.  All exams
will be weighted equally and the lowest grade will be dropped.
My hope is that enough of you will do well in the course that you
will not have to take the final exam.  Largely to reward attendance
and to ensure that you're not completely asleep (since it is a late
class), I may choose to give a few quizzes. These will be intended to
be quite easy and you will be able to complete them during the lecture
using information obtained from the lecture.
